<p class='pindent'>There were three events which we used to look
forward to at the approach of summer with a great
deal of interest. These were the Fourth of July,
General Training and Camp Meeting. The denizens
of a city can hardly understand the pleasure with
which the inhabitants of a secluded village hail any
thing out of the usual quiet routine of existence. Consequently
they would be likely to stare at the very
idea of any one who was old enough to drive fast trotters,
attend cock-fights, shoot balls over billiard-tables,
and dance the polka, attaching any importance to such
ordinary if not “decidedly vulgar” matters. But with
all due deference to the dandies, I must still reiterate
that we thought these three things of much consequence,
and entitled to the place of events in our
simple village calendar. The Fourth of July was a
great affair, inasmuch as it was not only great in itself,
but it opened as it were the gates of the decided summer,
letting in upon us those long delicious hours
when the sun’s eye begins to glance through its cloud
lashes at three in the morning, and shoots up its light
to wink and glimmer until nine in the evening. Camp
Meeting was also very important—inherently of course—and
also as coming as it did in October, it shut those
same summer portals, and reminded us of the occasional
pretence of Jack Frost, that jackall of winter,
who comes prowling amidst our gardens some time
before the stern roar of the old lion is heard. But
General Training occurring in August, sandwiched
between the two—the summit-level, so to speak, of the
season—the acme—the apex—was, on the whole, the
greatest event of the three. It was coupled with nothing
else, either as herald of bright days, or reminder
that those days were past. It had neither the brilliance
of hope nor the fragrance of memory. It was therefore
self-sustained—it shone by its own light. And
full of the elements of enjoyment was it. So much
bustle and noise—such rattle-te-bang topsy-turvy
scenes—such unloosing of the elements of fun—such
odd admixtures and jumblings together of objects, all
broadly picturesque and ludicrous, did the day present,
that no wonder it created such a sensation in our
usually quiet and well behaved village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the contrast last hinted at constituted one of its
charms to me, I will commence by sketching the appearance
of the village the evening before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will suppose the time to be about six o’clock,
P. M. in the last week of August. The sun is about
an hour and a half high, and is beginning to throw out
rays of the richest and at the same time the softest
splendor. A broad beam, like a golden vista, strikes
Rumsey’s house on the hill right along the toes, thence,
darting a blow athwart the breast of Fairchild’s domicil,
it hits St. John’s store right in the abdomen, and
then sinks down the slope of the street. This is on
one side of the village. On the other, a second beam
comes along in a sort of stealthy, zigzag manner, being
broken by a row of trees, until, blazes! it pitches into
the two lower eyes of Coit’s dingy edifice so violently
as to make them flash again. After this feat, it laughs
along the verge of the village green, making it wear
an edging of gold, and then paints the black picture of
the mail-coach before Hamble’s door in such grotesque
proportions as to send the head of one horse poking
into the middle of the street, and his tail streaming
into Cady’s store. And not only this, but the beam
sketches the figure of Hamble himself coming from
“Saint’s store,” with a bottle of “sour wine” for his
bar, in one hand, and a white pitcher brimming with
the cool nectar from the “corner well” in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you believe it? these were the only objects
visible in the street. How all the inhabitants had contrived
to withhold themselves from sight in this mellow
sunset I cannot imagine. But such was the fact.
The houses stood protruding their noses of porches at
those opposite, and peering into one another’s eyes,
with their dark wigs cutting against the soft amber
sky—the trees were whispering soft things to one another
in a gentle breeze stirring, each one moving its
thousand lips so delicately that the sunlight which was
kissing them seemed trembling with rapture—in short,
an air of quiet solitude brooded over the whole place.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
By and by the quick rattle of wheels struck upon
my ear, and looking in the direction of the sound,
I saw a two-horse wagon coming furiously down the
street with a collection of white, red, and black plumes,
with bayonets and gun-barrels glistening above, and
a great blue standard fluttering over the whole. A
strain of martial music simultaneously struck up from
amongst the warlike array, which array to my nearer
vision, resolved itself into a dozen men, “armed and
equipped as the law directs,” including a fifer, who
was lengthening his visage into a puckered whistle
upon his little yellow tube, a drummer, who was entangling
his sticks in the loudest manner on the sounding
sheep-skin, and a bass-drum player, who had hung
his huge instrument, like a great barrel, at the end of
the wagon, and who, being a little the worse for liquor,
(shown by constant lurches,) came down upon the
quivering circles each side with prodigious vigor at
precisely the wrong times, thereby breaking up and
almost overpowering the tune by an irregular succession
of boom—boom—boom-boom-booms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the wagon pulled up with an emphasis at Wiggins’s,
three huzzas rent the air from the occupants,
a dozen shots, in which were mingled the round, deep
tone of the musket, and the short, peevish crack of
the ride succeeded—and the “sodgers” bounded upon
the stoop, streamed into the bar-room, calling for
“liquor,” and lo! the “premonitory symptoms” of
General Training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this temporary ripple in the current, the village
again settled down into its customary quiet. The sun
disappeared—the golden glow crept up the western
sky as if to greet the “hunter’s moon,” that looked in
the sweet twilight like an orb of pearl, becoming, however,
momentarily brighter, like the hope of a holy
heart as the night of the grave approaches. And soon
the gold was chased down by the silver, and the beautiful
moonlight lay as if it was tangible sleep upon the
village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About ten o’clock I took one of my solitary walks
along the single street. Nothing could be more silent
and solitary. The soft yet splendid sheen streamed
down upon the roof, and whilst the dwellings upon
one side of the spacious thoroughfare were bathed in
lovely light, those opposite were lying in the deepest
blackness. The tricks of the moonlight were various.
The old weather streaked Court-House looked as white
and new as the smart Presbyterian “Meeting-House”
just erected, whilst its belfry (so open that it seemed
as if it would ring its own bell when the wind blew)
cocked itself up with a pert air, like the upturned nose
of a conceited man, and the red pimple of a clerk’s
office between both Court and Meeting-House, looked
redder than ever. Hamble’s rough stone wall was
sleeked over very prettily, sending out from its summit
gleams of light like silver flashes—the white chips
about his wood-shed were like patches of snow—the
shadow of a log, with an axe struck into it, seemed
like a black pump lying prostrate—the shrubbery in
the little enclosure along the side of the tavern, sparkled
out into a million of eyes—the sign, with the red coach
upon it, going so fast that its wheels were nothing but
spokes, and the horses so fierce that they were galloping
right up into the air, looked bright as a new button,
<a id='whilst'></a>whilst the broad village green seemed like an expanse
of (if I may use the expression) solidified light. I
turned to pursue my walk. The fluted pillars of St.
John’s store looked “good enough to eat,” as a rather
matter-of-fact girl once observed to me in a moonlight
walk, and the “corner well,” with its long arm of a
pole reared over its head, and its bucket tucked down
at its front, seemed as if it had just drank and had put
down its glass. I still made my way up the street.
Not a single person abroad, not a light to be seen—it
appeared as if the whole village had grown out, as it
were, of the quiet and beautiful light that lay so broadly
upon it. Tired at last of being the only watcher in
the silent village, I retraced my steps, and (to speak
vulgarly) “went to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was awakened by martial music in full blast. I
dressed myself and sallied out. A broad beam of the
newly risen sun had settled like a yellow pool just in
front of Wiggins’s tavern, and standing within it, were
the three worthies who had awakened the Monticello
echoes the evening before with their music from the
wagon. The fifer was again spitting his breath most
industriously into his “whistle,” as the boys called it,
and keeping time with his foot, the drummer, who had
a way of looking down upon his drum, and working
his mouth to the motion of his sticks, was sending out
his rattling tones by his side, and facing the two, with his
shoulders drawn back, and supporting his instrument
on his breast, the bass-drummer was bringing down
his leathered knobs this time to the music, (he had
only had two morning bitters, so Wiggins said,) but
with such a terrific noise as to make even himself
wince at every stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was quite a collection of men around the
“musicianers;” several with brown cartridge-boxes
and bayonet-sheaths, and one or two with gilt eagles
in their hats, and plumes of white feathers, whilst one
fellow was equipped with an old straw hat, the rim of
which was shorn away at his forehead—a red flannel
shirt, linsey-woolsey pantaloons, and a long, heavy
rifle on his shoulder. This genius was fairly wrapped
up in the music. He was evidently enchanted. Now
he would listen with his mouth wide open, then he
would look around the group and nod, as if to say,
“<span class='it'>isn’t</span> that fine!” and then he would give birth to
laughter, as though he couldn’t restrain himself any
longer for the life of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Interspersed amidst this group were many of the
village boys, edging their way at every practicable
point nearer the musicians. One youngster, ragged as
a saw, had succeeded in placing himself by the tenor
drum, and was looking at the double performance of
mouth and sticks, with the greatest admiration, whilst
another, with open elbows and slouched hat, which
was only prevented by a bulge in front from sliding
entirely over his dirty face, was peering up into the
twitching countenance of the bass-drummer, standing
the thunder of the blows with all the nonchalance of a
real veteran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My attention was now, however, attracted toward
the genius with the rifle, by his giving birth to a loud
shout. Inflamed beyond bounds by the music which
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
was now on a rattling quick-step, the red flanneled gentleman
now made a spring in the air, and then dashed
out into a “heel and toe” dance, flourishing his rifle as
if it had been a walking-stick, now over his head, and
now on each side of him, and making every thing
fairly echo with his loud and frequent whoops. He
at length became the <a id='lode'></a>lodestone of all eyes, except those
of the musicians, fairly driving these worthies in the
most ungrateful manner (they being the source of his
inspiration) into the shade; becoming, as it were, the
centre of a circle of grinning faces, until completely
tired out with his exertions, he broke away, ascended
the tavern stoop, and the next moment made the bar-room
ring with his vociferation for “a small pull of
some of the <a id='real'></a>real grit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By and by the “trainers” began to appear at all
points, some in groups, some singly, some by wagon
loads. And one wagon came in so filled with bristling
muskets, that it had the appearance of a huge steel
porcupine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The population of the surrounding country, men,
women and children, commenced streaming in to gaze
upon “the show,” and make merry amongst themselves.
A number also of the surrounding farmers and
their wives came as venders of pies, cake, small beer,
cider, etc., turning their wagons into shops, wheeling
them under the shadows of the trees, detaching the
horses, flinging at the same time quantities of hay before
them, and covering the seats of the wagons with
cards of yellow gingerbread, mingled with pies, carved
generally into quarters, and cider barrels at the ends,
with faucets resembling hooked noses. Others again
had erected booths of rough boards or hemlock boughs
filled with articles of consumption. I looked at one
for a few moments which Aunt Betsy Lossing had (as
usual) erected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was composed of hemlock boards, with branches
of the same tree. A rude counter had been placed
athwart the entrance, behind which appeared Betsy’s
red face and burly form, together with a boy and girl
as assistants. Upon shelves were rows of casks lettered
gin, brandy, whisky, etc.; on the highest shelf were
two or three boxes of cigars, a dozen thick glass
tumblers, and a small box of lemons, whilst below all,
two barrels of cider (probably) looked out dimly from
the shadow. The sunshine streamed richly in, lighting
the lemons brilliantly, giving to the cigars a warm
tint of brown, flashing upon the gilt letters of the
casks, dancing on the glasses, and only failing to
penetrate the recess where the barrels lay on their
stomachs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still did the soldiery and country people stream in.
By this time several <a id='ped'></a>pedlers had established their box
wagons upon the grassy margins of the broad village
street, and were as clamorous in their vocations as
crows around a carrion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The village was now a scene of active, noisy, bustling
life. I amused myself for a short time by examining
in detail the human current that flowed past my office
steps. Now passed a pair of country lovers, the girl
in the act of biting off a huge piece of mince pie,
whilst the “he” was industriously engaged in puffing
at a great black cigar, giving his rosy-cheeked sweetheart
the benefit of the smoke gratis. Next a
little rustic maiden alone, all beflowered and beribboned
like a walking milliner shop; then a young woodsman,
who had scarcely ever emerged from the forest before,
but who had “left the saw-mill to-day to go a trainen,”
sauntered past with his rusty old musket (which doubtless
did service at Minisink in “granddaddy’s” hands)
horizontal upon his shoulder; then a rough-looking
check-shirted hunter, with his rifle in his grasp, and
then a bumpkin from “Strong’s Settlement,” with
his hands deep in his pockets, his “limpsey” hat upon
one side of his head, minus half the crown and the
whole of the rim, and opening his gray eyes so wide
as fairly to pull his mouth open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Succeeding this interesting specimen of humanity,
minced along a youthful, undersized soldier, in an old
blue artillery coat, made in the Revolution, the red-striped
skirts striking his heels, the breast down to his
hips, and the sleeves tucked up nearly to the elbows;
and next strode a brawny hero, who crowded
himself into a gray cavalry jacket, with its shadow of
a skirt cocked up behind like the brush of a deer, and
the breasts shrinking away nearly under his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say there, hadn’t you two fellers better swap?”
shouted a pedler from his box as the twain passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darn me,” added he, in an under tone, as they went
regardless along, “if one of them are chaps don’t look
loose enuff to run out of his coat like this ere old
woman’s cider, whilst that are other crittur is screwed
up so tight that he’ll sartenly bust up afore long.
However it’s their business, not mine. <span class='sc'>Here’s</span> a
lot of fine spoons! no Garman silver about <span class='it'>them</span>. Come,
roll up, tumble up, any way to get up—come, give us
a bid!” etc. etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rolling of drums now announced that the time
for the mustering of the different companies composing
the regiment (the bloody 185th) had arrived. Lines of soldiers
were soon seen scattered along the street, and the
loud voices of the sergeants calling the roll were heard.
There were two uniform companies attached to the
regiment, beside “the troop,” or light-horse company,
viz., the artillery and rifle. The dress of the former
was a blue jacket, with red tufts on the shoulders, and
caps with red tufts in front, whilst that of the latter
was a green hunting shirt fringed with black, with
black plumes in their hats. The cavalry company
were dressed in red coats faced and cuffed with black
velvet. The rest of the regiment were clothed, some
in odd uniforms, others in their every-day clothing, and
presented a strange and motley array of colors and accoutrements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preliminaries being gone through, the arduous
duty of forming the companies into line was now to
be accomplished. A great stir was at this instant
discernible amongst the crowd before Wiggins’s steps,
and shortly I observed the figures of several officers
waving and glittering with feathers and tinsel rising
above the surface of heads as they mounted their
prancing steeds. Spurring them through the throng,
they succeeded after a while in clearing a long space
and extending the breadth of the village street. The
word was then given to form the line, and amidst the
loud orders of the officers I could see the different
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
squads arranging themselves into marching order. A
few minutes elapsed, and then arose a din sufficient to
drive one crazy, and yet of the most ludicrous character.
Each company was furnished with its own drum and
fife, and, in some instances, bass-drum and cymbals.
The three or four companies near me commenced
marching in columns at nearly the same moment, their
respective bands striking up at the same time, each
playing its own tune. The effect was laughable in the
highest degree. “Hail Columbia” had its slow heels
tripped up completely by the <span class='it'>pirouettes</span> of “Yankee
Doodle;” the “Girl I Left Behind Me” and “Miller’s
Quick Step,” locked themselves together in a perfect
wrestling match, first one down, then the other—now
a bar struggling convulsively, then a strain nearly
throttled; then high and low notes, tug and tug, heard
alternately, the whole at last mingling itself up into the
strangest entanglement possible—a maelstrom, so to
speak, of whirling music. A bass-drum would thunder
down, breaking the back at a stroke of a long roll proceeding
from a tenor one near by, whilst another of
the latter species would rub-a-dub right into a pair of
cymbals, and scatter their silver clashings into an
entire route. New tunes would be constantly arriving
as the distant companies came marching up to give
fresh life to the wrangling discord, whilst to add to the
uproar, the whole pack of pedlers, amounting to nearly
a dozen, had given tongue at the first hurly-burly of
the music, bursting out, as it were, in full cry. “<span class='it'>Here’s</span>
your fine penknives, all a going at onst,” shouted a tall,
ram-rod looking fellow, with a knob of a hat, and a nose
that seemed stretching out on purpose to scent a good
bargain. “Walk up, ladies and gentlemen,” bawled
another, with a white broad-brim so weak and slouchy
as to look as if about to faint away off his head.
“How much for this splendid necklace!” yelled another,
in a higher key, with the rim of his beaver
cocked fiercely in front, and with a patch in the back
of his coat, as though he had an eye there to look after
his articles in that direction. “Come, gentlemen, can’t
wait, onst, twice! wont you say sixpence more!” said
a fourth, sinking from a shout gradually down to a
coaxing whine, whilst a fifth, with straight, black hair
and saturnine complexion, giving him quite a sanctimonious
look, let his tongue run on in chase of “a
penny, a penny, a penny, a penny,” with the perseverance
of a bloodhound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elevated on one of the wagons was a member of
the light-horse company. He had taken the post as a
matter of joke, and was now holding up the different
articles for sale with a merry smile on his face, and
every now and then winking to the crowd as if to remind
them what a capital jest his being there was.
The pedler himself in the meanwhile, with an apple
of a face perched upon a bean-pole of a form, was with
great <span class='it'>nonchalance</span> seated upon his box, evidently
quite content that the light-horseman should do the
work, and he sit by and receive the profits. So exciting
and pleasant did the soldier find his self-imposed
task, so elated by the possession of this new accomplishment,
which had remained undeveloped even to
himself until now, and so intoxicated with the flattery
which the laughter of the throng at his jokes offered,
that he continued there all day, incurring a fine for
non-attendance at the parade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the next “General Training” I saw the same
fellow. Turned topsy-turvy by his success, he had
abandoned his farm and “took to peddlen” on his own
hook. But what a difference. Interested now in the
occupation personally, and having the “keenest sort”
of an eye to the profits, his selling was no longer a joke.
The merry glance was replaced by a look of care, his
dashing, off-hand manner was exchanged for an eager,
beseeching air, his jokes were few and evidently
forced; in short, in making his amusement his trade,
he had made himself a very poor pedler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What became of him I don’t know, but I heard
casually once that he had after a while betaken himself
again to his little farm, (which he had mortgaged
to obtain his fitting out as a pedler,) quite broken-spirited
and out at elbows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Foremost in the tempest of martial music, towering,
as it were, the very genius of the scene, was Joe
Lippett. Joe was a capital hand at a fife, his long chin
serving as a resting-place for the instrument. He was
therefore engaged to play for half a dozen companies.
It was a sight to see him. Marching forward with
immense strides, his puckered lips and promontory-like
chin forming a deep nook into which his fife was
thrust, he sent forth his piercing notes like a north-wester.
After escorting a company “into line,” he
would vanish, and in a minute would be seen at the
head of another, blowing away like Tophet, and after
performing the same service to it, <span class='it'>presto!</span> his shrill
music would be heard, and his legs and chin seen
coming from a different quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after great exertions, involving vast displays
of horsemanship, and large, particularly guttural, words
of command, continual risings in their stirrups, and
occasional looks of deep ferocity, the junior officers of
the day succeeded in getting the regiment into line, as
it is called in military parlance, but in fact into a curve,
as the middle sagged a good deal inward. Still it presented
something of a front, and along it the young
officers went into violent spasms of dexterous riding,
spurring their horses and curbing them tightly at the
same time, thus causing them to advance backward, as
it were, and perform feats with their hoofs, somewhat
dangerous to the pie-eating and cider-drinking spectators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length I discovered the cause of this great display
by the youthful gods of war, by happening to observe
them glancing at the windows opposite, where I discovered
their dulcineas looking at the whole affair
with immense interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was amusing to note the various aspects of the
soldiers composing the line. One had a nose like a
triangle, another as if an oblong piece of dough had
hit him in the face, and had clung there; the next had
a little pair of eyes flying about as if anxious to hide
away in their sockets, whilst the next appeared so determined
to stare with his great goggle eyes that he
seemed to suppose to wink would be time wasted.
Here was a mouth with the corners turned up into a
sculptured grin; there was another turned down, as if
with a perpetual colic. Here were cheeks rounded
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
out as if blowing a trumpet, whilst there were others so
fallen in, that they seemed glued to their side teeth. In
short, there was no end to the differences in the physiognomies
of the “citizen soldiery,” as that patriotic
and intellectual portion of our people, the politicians,
(those particularly who wish to go to the “legislater,”)
term them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A file of men was now detached for the standard of
the regiment—a great blue thing, as large nearly as a
ship’s top-sail. The men were paraded in front of the
tavern steps—the standard appeared on the stoop—a
flourish of drum and fife—the standard waved, then
descended, and borne by little Billy Waddle, went
gayly to its appointed place under the inspiriting influence
of a favorite quick step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reception of the colonel was now also gone
through, and he rode in very stiff dignity, with his legs
sticking out on each side of his steed, very much like
a pair of open compasses, toward the line, with his
peacock tail of a staff trailing behind him. Taking,
then, his station, with his horse (tickled constantly by
the spur) making uneasy motions, as if itching all over,
he gave utterance to a few shouts, made hoarse for
the occasion, which were followed by convulsions of
carrying, presenting, and supporting arms, on the part
of the soldiers, some together, and some not, just as it
happened. Preparations were then made for the
march to the village-green, where the exercises of the
day were to take place. The music was all collected
in front, and the order was given to wheel into platoons.
Each man performed this manœuvre at his own time
and “on his own responsibility,” and consequently
such a fluttering took place as to throw the whole
scene into confusion. The feat was, however, at last
performed, the drums began to mark time—the men
ditto, (after a fashion,) and the order from the colonel
was, “by platoons, march!” the last word uttered
with most tremendous emphasis. The order was
taken up and sent along from company to company in
every variety of tone, from a growl to a squeak,
ending at last like a faint echo at the extremity of the
array. The whole regiment then moved, the drums
still keeping up their preliminary tapping. At length
the music burst out into a terrific explosion of sound,
and onward marched the martial pageant. The sight
was ludicrous enough. Some had started with
the right foot foremost, and were entangling their
legs in the most unjustifiable way, with those of their
neighbors, endeavoring to change to the left foot;
some, owing to the extreme tightness of their belts,
(these were principally in the uniform companies,)
hitched along as if their hips went on rusty hinges, and
others, owing either to the want of a musical ear, or
recklessness, sauntered along in their natural gait,
which didn’t happen to suit the air, and consequently
carried disorder along the whole rank. In the former
class was a little irascible-looking fellow, who, starting
the wrong way and endeavoring to get right, and who
being met in his efforts at precisely the wrong times
by a lank genius next him, kept hopping testily from
one foot to the other, whilst his companion did the
same at alternate moments, until the legs of both went
backward and forward like a quick cat’s-cradle. On
swept the array, the colonel looking sterner than forty
Napoleons on a field of battle. Conspicuous in the
front rank of “the music” was Joe Lippett, chinning
his fife, whilst amidst a row of drums came my friend
with the red feather, working his mouth in the most
emphatic manner, and looking down upon his instrument
as if he thought that the withdrawal of his eyes
would cause an instant paralysis of his sticks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed the artillery and rifle companies, and
in the midst of the regiment, who should appear but
little Billy Waddle, staggering up under the enormous
regimental standard. Billy, in being the bearer of the
silken honor, had allowed his ambition to run away
with his discretion. He was evidently supplying his
strength from the very depths of his despair, humoring
in a variety of ways the blue flaunting tyrant which
held him completely under control, bracing against its
frequent lurches with efforts that made him grin like a
death’s-head, and struggling up convulsively as it
plunged downward with pitchings and totterings worthy
an animal afflicted with the blind staggers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With wonderful efforts, however, he continued to
keep the flag somewhat in order, until he arrived opposite
my office. A beautiful basswood was growing
there, on the outer verge of the side-walk, and spreading
its broad branches considerably over the street.
The regiment swept underneath these branches in its
progress upward to the village-green. Billy saw the
impediment and lowered his standard. He did it,
however, with such quick effort, that he lost all control
over its descending weight, which pitched the
luckless manikin forward so irresistibly that the steel
points of the staff struck with somewhat of an emphasis
right into the calf of Jim Thompson’s leg, who happened
to be marching directly before. Never shall I
forget Jim’s hop on the occasion, or the terrified look
he cast backward. It appeared as if he thought that
the rear rank had suddenly taken it into their heads to
charge bayonet upon those in front, and that he was
to be the first victim. But his look changed as he
perceived the cause, and the glance of contempt and
vexation which he shot at poor Billy, as he commenced
limping along rubbing the offended part, was
ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regiment now arrived at the green, where it
was to be inspected. The Inspector was an imperturbable,
square-built Dutchman, bestriding a horse
as imperturbable and donkey-like as himself. He
now appeared upon the ground, as the regiment,
after performing half the circuit of the green, was
halted in the order it had marched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismounting, the inspector gravely commenced his
task. Moving from man to man, he examined the
musket and other accoutrements of each, the inspected
bringing his piece to a present with a quick jerk as the
inspector presented himself, and the latter trying the
lock with a sharp click, and making the ramrod jump
with a keen jingle in the barrel. Occasionally, some
piece, loaded by its wag of an owner, would explode
with a loud report as the inspector drew trigger, followed
by a great snickering and chuckling on the part
of those near by, but the inspector never relaxed
his heavy muscles for a moment. Thus he went from
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
man to man, and rank to rank, until the whole process
was completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile the music had gathered in a cluster
at a little distance, surrounded by the boys and
“loafers” of the village. Now and then the muffled
sound of a tattoo, beat upon the cords of the drum, arose,
with the comic squeak of a fife accompanied by loud
laughter from the idlers around, and sometimes a single
“boom” from a blow upon the bass-drum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the <a id='inspec'></a>inspector, having left his last man, the word
“attention the whole,” was loudly sounded, and the
scene was changed in an instant. Those who had
been lounging “at ease” upon their guns, stood erect
and soldier-like—those seated upon the grass sprung
to their places—the band hurried to its station at the
head, and, in a short time the whole regiment was in
marching order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time had now arrived to pass in review before
the colonel. With his staff upon either hand, that redoubtable
hero had now stationed himself at the head
of the green for the regiment to march past him. The
command of “march” was given, the music struck
up, and the regiment moved. Playing most obstreperously,
the band passed the colonel, who sat, chapeau
in hand, and then fell upon one side. The sight now
became comic. The officers as they approached, prepared
with great solemnity and very apparent consciousness
of the importance of the manœuvre, to
salute with their swords the puissant presence of the
commandant, and the “rank and file” to perform the
same ceremony with their presented guns. The first
officer, who was a captain from the wilds of Lumberland,
was so taken up by the immensity of the act he
was to perform, that he forgot to perform it at all until
quite past the colonel. Remembering himself then, in
his nervous hurry, he brought his sword up so quickly
to his face that he knocked his hat off, and stooping to
recover it, he received such an impetus from his front
rank, who were too intent upon their part of the performance
to see any thing, that he was pitched without
ceremony, in the most headlong and sprawling manner,
after his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next officer was but a little more fortunate.
He had witnessed the performance of his predecessor,
and being nervous, was thrown into a considerable
flurry thereby. Determined not to be caught in the
predicament of delaying his manœuvre, he went to the
opposite extreme. Miscalculating his time in his
agitation, and seeing the colonel’s eye fixed upon him,
he, some distance before he reached that functionary,
brought his sword up with a great flourish, and saluted.
By the time he reached the colonel, his part was, of
course, performed, and the air of sneaking and deprecating
consciousness with which he slunk past was so
marked, as to cause a smile even upon the grim features
of the commandant himself. After this, things
went on pretty well, until a tall, awkward, rawboned
lieutenant, who “tended saw-mill for a liven” on the
Sheldrake Brook, approached the colonel. Fixing his
eyes on his officer, he thrust his sword out horizontally,
as if to charge bayonet. Not seeing where he was
going, so intent was he upon his staring, that, meeting
with some obstruction, he stumbled, pitched forward,
and before he could recover himself, he had run his
sword half way into the soft turf of the green, with
the hilt striking against his breast with an emphasis
that made him gasp like a frog in an exhausting receiver.
He was the last officer, and with this interesting
exhibition of soldierly grace and dignity, the
ceremony closed. The colonel clapped his chapeau on
his head, and, attended by his staff, once more took
his place in the regiment, and, after a short march, the
order was given to form a “hollow square,” for
prayer and a speech from the judge advocate. After
considerable trouble the square was formed, with all the
officers in the middle. The prayer was offered by
the “learned and pious” Dr. Stubbornthought, and at
the conclusion, the colonel proclaimed, in a pompous
tone, that the judge advocate would now commence
his address. Instantly this functionary spurred from
the side of his superior to perform this duty. He was
an ambitious young sprig of the law, always on the
look-out for distinction, and seeking where he could
make a speech turn up with all the keenness and avidity
of a hound on the track of a deer. He was withal
very irascible. With his usual ambition, he had now
selected the most fiery and run-away steed in the
village, being convinced that he was as good a horseman
as he was a speaker, and that, let me tell you, is
saying a great deal. Direct upon his announcement, as
before observed, he made his way in the midst of the
square, and endeavored to settle himself in his saddle
to commence his address. But this was more difficult
than he imagined. Having given a severer dig with his
spur into the side of his animal than the latter bargained
for or relished, it began to testify its anger by a series
of prancings and curvettings decidedly more ornamental
than either useful or agreeable. Grasping his bridle,
however, firmly, and knowing that delay in endeavoring
to soothe his horse might ruin his speech, the
youngster, after giving birth to a loud preliminary
h-e-m, commenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fellow-soldiers, (whoe, Jim,) I appear before ye,
(whoe, I say,) on this occasion to address you briefly
upon the duties of the citizen soldiery of our country.
The duty of defending our homes and firesides, (whoe,
whoe, you brute you,) our homes and firesides, (whoe,
you rascal,) homes and, (well, I never saw such a
devilish creature in my life, whoe, I say,) homes and
firesides is a paramount duty. Who—would—evade—it!
Who—wou-wou-wou-wou-would, (whoe, whoe,
who-o-o-e—you most infernal of all devils,) who would
sh-sh-sh-shun or fly”—here the question bolted out at
broken intervals, occasioned by the thumping in his
saddle from the prancing of his excited horse, was to
the great horror of the square, answered practically
by the questioner himself. If no body else would fly
he, or rather his steed, showed that he would. Giving
a tremendous leap, Spitfire (the horse’s name, and a
capital one, too,) broke through an opening in the
square and “rattle-te-clatter,” (as Loafing Joe, in describing
the scene afterward to a knot of the village
young men in Wiggins’s bar-room said,) “the way he
streaked it over the green, was nothen to nobody’s
folks. He went like a shot from a shovel past Old
Cheese’s as if he was a goen to pitch right into John
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
P.’s donyard. But old Spitfire catty-cornered round so
quick that “little Blackberry” (the rider’s nickname
in the village, from his dark complexion,) swung sideways
like old Lummocks when he’s slewed, and then,
Lordjersees Massies, if he didn’t slap it down the
turnpike in a hurry, with little Blackberry a hold of the
mane, and a grinning like a wild-cat, you may say to
my face that I’m a liar, that’s all. Howsever, Spitfire
couldn’t git past Wiggins’s, no how you can fix it,
for he’s eat too many oats there, so he gives another
sheer so that little Blackberry’s right leg stuck out like
a pump-handle, and bolt he went under the shed, and
brought up all standen. Little Blackberry pitched
into the manger, and the hoss began to eat hay as if
nothen had been the matter, and that, boys, is the eend
on’t. Who’s a goen to treat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, the regiment had been again
arranged in marching order, and with a <a id='blithe'></a>blithesome
quickstep, had left the green, swept up the little village
to its outskirts, and then turning, was now on its way
back to its starting place before Wiggins’s tavern-porch.
A cloud of dust gave token to those at the
porch that the martial show was approaching. The
piercing fife—the rub-a-dub of the drum—and the deep
blows of the bass-drum, were next heard; the arms
broke glistening from the dusty cloud—down came the
column with its hasty tread, and fronted before the
tavern in one long line. After a few words of command,
the magic words, “you’re dismissed,” sounded
upon the air, and with a wild hurrah, the ranks broke
into scrambling confusion, and “General Training”
was ended. Wagon after wagon filled with the
soldiery, rattled away; throng after throng of those
on foot hurried off by the numerous roads leading into
the adjacent country, and at sunset, the village had
once more relapsed into its customary quiet. So have
we seen a pool, shaken by a breeze, tossing its waters
in confusion, and then calming itself into its usual
tranquillity, uniting the scattered fragments of rock,
tree and sky, again into the soft, reflected picture of its
quiet and beautiful mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning was still very young, and the sun,
which was but just beginning to rise above the brow
of the eastern hill, poured his long, yellow rays, full
of a million dusty motes, in almost level lines down
the soft, green slopes, diversified by hundreds of cool
purple shadows, projected far and wide over the
laughing landscape, from every tree and bush that
intercepted the mild light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dews of the preceding night still clustered unexhaled,
sparkling like diamonds to the morning beams,
on every leaf and flower; a soft west wind was playing
gently with the thousands of bright buds and
blossoms which decked the pleasant gardens; and the
whole air was perfumed with the delicate fragrance
of the mignionette and roses, which filled the luxuriant
parterres. The hum of the reveling bees came to the
ear with a sweet domestic sound, and the rich carol of
the blackbird and the thrush came swelling from the
tangled shrubberies, full fraught with gratitude and
glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was into such a scene, and among such sights and
sounds, that the young free-trader wandered forth from
the tranquillity and gloom of the sick chamber in which
he had spent a sleepless night; but his mind had been
too deeply stirred by his conversation with Sir Miles
St. Aubyn, and chords of too powerful feeling had been
thrilled into sudden and painful life, to allow him to be
penetrated, as he might have been in a less agitated
hour, by the sweet influences of the time and season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, though he was unconscious of the pleasant
sights and sounds and smells which surrounded him,
as he strolled slowly through the bowery walks of the
old garden, they had more or less effect upon his perturbed
and bitter spirit; and his mood became gradually
softer, as he mused upon what had passed within
the last hour, alone in that bright solitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild and impetuous and almost fierce by nature, he
had brooded from his very boyhood upward over his
real and imaginary wrongs, until the iron had so deeply
pierced his soul, that he could see nothing but coldness,
and hostility, and persecution in the conduct of all
around him, with the exception of his old student uncle
and his sweet Theresa. Ever suspecting, ever anticipating
injury and insult, or at least coldness and repulsion
from all with whom he was brought into contact,
he actually generated in the breasts of others the feelings
which he imputed to them all unjustly. Accusing
the world of injustice or ere it was unjust, in the end
he made it to be so indeed; and then hated it, and railed
against it, for that which it had never dreamed of, but
for his own fantastic waywardness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was unfortunate for Durzil, that the good man,
into whose care he had fallen, ever of a philosophical
and studious, nay, even mystic disposition, had become,
since the sad fate of his beloved sister, and the early
death of a yet dearer wife, so wholly visionary, so
entirely given up to the wildest theorizing, the most
abstruse and abstract metaphysical inquiries, that no
one could have been devised less fitting for the guardian
and instructor of a high-spirited, hot-headed, fiery
boy than he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequence of this was, as it might have been
expected, that disgusted early with the strange sorts
of learning which the old man persisted in forcing into
him against the grain, and discontented with the stillness
and deathlike tranquillity of all around him, the
boy ran away from his distasteful home, and shipped
for the India voyage in a free-trader, half merchantman,
half-picaroon, before he had yet attained his thirteenth
year. In that wild and turbulent career, well suited to
his daring and contemptuous spirit, he had, as he himself
expressed it, become hardened and inured not to
toils and sufferings only, but to thoughts and feelings,
habits and opinions, which perhaps now could never
be eradicated from his nature, of which they had become,
as it were, part and parcel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned, well nigh a man in years, and
quite a man in stature, and perhaps more than most men
in courage, resource, coolness and audacity, old Allan,
to whom he had written once or twice, apprising him
that he had adopted the sea as his home and his profession,
received him with a hearty welcome, and with
few or no inquiries as to the period during which he
had been absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, he came and went as he would, unasked
and unheeded. When he was ashore, the cottage by
the fords of Widecomb was his home; and his increasing
wealth—for he had prospered greatly in his
adventurous career—added materially to the comforts
of old Allan’s housekeeping. His life was, therefore,
spent in strange alternations; now amid the wildest
excitement—the storm, the chase, the fierce and frantic
speculation, the perilous and desperate fight, the revelry,
the triumph, and the booty; and now, in the calmest
and most peaceful solitude, amid the sweetest pastoral
scenery, and with the loveliest and most innocent companion
that ever soothed the hot and eager spirit of
erring and impetuous man, into almost woman’s softness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And hence it was, perhaps, that Durzil Bras-de-fer
had, as it were, two different natures—one fierce, rash,
bitter, scornful, heedless of human praise or human
censure, pitiless to human sorrow, reckless of human
life, merciless, almost cruel—the other generous, and
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
soft, and sympathetic, and full of every good and gentle
impulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it was in the latter of these only, that Theresa
Allan knew him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not be supposed from what I have written,
that Durzil was a pirate, or a buccaneer—far from it.
For though, at times, he and his comrades assumed
the initiative in warfare, and smote the Spaniards and
the Dutchmen, and the French unsparingly, beyond the
Line, and made but small distinction between the
<span class='it'>meum</span> and the <span class='it'>tuum</span>, especially if the <span class='it'>tuum</span> pertained
to the stranger and the papist, still neither public
opinion, nor their own consciences condemned them—they
were regarded, as Cavendish, and Raleigh, and
Drake, and Frobisher and Hawkins had been, a reign
or two before, as bold, headlong adventurers; perhaps
a little lawless, but on the whole, noble and daring
men, and were esteemed in general rather an ornament
than a disgrace to their native land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As men are esteemed of men, such they are very apt
to be or to become; and, having the repute of chivalrous
spirit, of generosity and worth, no less than of
dauntless courage, and rare seamanship, the adventurous
free-traders of that day held themselves to be,
in all respects, gentlemen, and men of honor; and
holding themselves so, for the most part they became so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, therefore, by no means either wonderful or
an exception to a rule, that Durzil Bras-de-fer should
have been such as I have described him, awake to
gentle impulses, alive to good impressions, easily subject
to the influences of the finest female society, and
in no respect a person either from his habits, his tastes,
or his profession to be rejected by men of honor, or
eschewed by women of refinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, as he followed slowly on the steps of his
beautiful cousin, the young man was more alive than
usual to the higher and nobler sensibilities of his mind.
The information which he had gained concerning his
own father’s feelings, at the moment of his death, had
greatly softened him, and it began to occur to him—which
was, indeed, true—that he might have been
during his whole life conjuring up phantoms against
which to do battle, and attributing thoughts and actions
to the world at large, of which the world might well
be wholly innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to this moment, although he had long been aware
of his constantly increasing passion for his fair cousin,
he had rested content with the mild and sisterlike affection
which she had ever manifested toward him; and,
having been ever her sole companion, ever treated
with most perfect confidence and sympathy, having
found her at all times charmed to greet his return, and
grieved at his departure; knowing, above all things,
that at the very worst he had no rival, and that her
heart had never been touched by any warmer passion
than she felt toward himself, he had scarcely paused to
inquire even of himself, whether he was beloved in
turn, much less had he endeavored to penetrate the
secrets of her heart, or to disturb the calm tenor of
her way by words or thoughts of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, the words, the questions of the old
cavalier had awakened many a doubt in his soul; and
with the doubt came the desire irrepressible to envisage
his fate, to learn and ascertain, once and for all, whether
his lot was to be cast henceforth in joy or in sorrow;
whether, in a word, he was to be a wanderer and an
outcast, by sea and by land, unto his dying day, or
whether this very hour was to be to him the commencement
of a new era, a new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as he walked forth in the beautiful calm
morning, in that old, pleasant garden, which had been
the scene of so much peaceable and innocent enjoyment,
he felt himself at once a sadder and a better man than
he had ever been before; and while determined to
delay no longer, but to try his gentle cousin’s heart, he
was supported by no high and fiery hope; he seemed
to have lost, he knew not how or wherefore, that proud
heaven-reaching confidence, which was wont to count
all things won while they were yet to win, still less
did his heart kindle and blaze out with that preconceived
indignation at the idea of being unappreciated
or neglected, which would a few hours before have
goaded him almost to frenzy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have written much of his character to little purpose,
if it be not plain that humility was the frame of mind
least usual to the youthful seaman, yet now, for once,
he was humble. He had discovered, for the first time
in his life, that he had erred grossly in his estimate of
others, and was beginning to suspect that that false
estimate had led him far away from true principles,
true conceptions; he was beginning, in a word, to suspect
that he was himself <span class='it'>less</span> sinned against than
sinning; and that his was, in fact, a very much misguided
and distempered spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clasped his brow closely with a feverish and
trembling hand, as he walked onward slowly, pondering,
with his whole soul intent upon the future and the
past. He was inquiring of himself, “Does she, can
she love me?” and he could make no answer to his
own passionate questioning. While he was in this
mood, bending his steps toward the favorite bower
wherein he half hoped half feared to find Theresa, a
soft voice fell upon his ear, and a light hand was laid
upon his arm, as he passed the intersection of another
shady walk with that through which he was
strolling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morrow, Durzil,” said the young girl, merrily.
“I never thought to see you out so early in the garden;
but I am glad that you are here, for I want you. So
come along with me at once, and tell me if it be not
a nest of young nightingales which I have found in the
thick syringa bush beside my arbor. Come, Durzil,
don’t you hear me? Why what ails you, that you
look so sad, and move so heavily this glorious summer
morning? You are not ill, are you, dear Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Durzil,” he repeated, in a low, subdued tone.
“<span class='it'>Dear</span> Durzil! I would to God that I were dear to
you, Theresa—that I were dear to any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So singular was the desponding tone in which he
spoke, so strange and unwonted was the cloud of
deep depression which sat on his bold, intelligent brow,
that the young girl stared at him in amazement, almost
in alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are ill,” she cried, in tones of affectionate
anxiety; “you must be ill, or you would never speak
so strangely, so unkindly; or is it only that you are
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
overdone with watching by that poor youth’s sick
bed? Yet no, no, that can never be, you who are so
strong and so hardy. What is it, dearest cousin?
Tell me, what is it makes you speak so wildly—would
that you <span class='it'>were</span> dear to me! why, if not you, <span class='it'>you</span> and
my good, kind father, who on the face of the wide
earth is dear to poor Theresa! That you were dear to
any one! You, whom my father looks upon and loves
as his own son; you, whose companions hold you as
almost more than mortal—for have I not marked the
inscriptions on your sabre’s guard, and on the telescope
they gave you? You, who have saved the lives
of so many fellow mortals; you, to whom those ladies,
rescued at Darien from the bloodthirsty Spaniards,
addressed such glowing words of gratitude and love;
you, cousin Durzil, <span class='it'>you</span>, who are so great, so brave,
so wise, so skillful, and above all, so generous and
kind; <span class='it'>you</span> talk of wishing you were dear to any one!
Good sooth! you must be dreaming, or you are bewitched,
gentle Durzil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I be,” he replied with a smile, for her high
spirits and gay enthusiasm aroused him from his
gloomier thoughts, and began to enkindle brighter hopes
in his bosom, “if I be, thou, Theresa, art the enchantress
who has done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! now you are more like yourself; but tell me,”
she said, caressingly, “what was it made you sad and
dark but now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this, dear Theresa, that I am again about to
leave you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To leave us—to leave us so soon and so suddenly.
Why you have been here but three little weeks, which
have passed like so many days, and when you came
you said that you would stay with us till autumn. Oh,
dear! my father will be so grieved at your going. You
do not know, you do not dream how much he loves
you, Durzil. He is a different person altogether when
you are at home—so much gayer, and more sociable!
Oh! wherefore must you leave us so quickly, and
after so long an absence, too, as your last? Oh, truly,
it is unkind, Durzil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Theresa, shall you be sorry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not answer you,” she replied, half petulantly,
half tearfully. “It is unkind of you to go, and doubly
unkind of you to speak to me thus. What have I done
to you now, what have I ever done to you, that you
should doubt my being sorry. Are not you the only
friend, the only companion I have got in the wide
world? Are you not as near and dear to me, as if you
were my own brother? Do not I love you as my
brother, even as my father loves you as his son? Ah,
Durzil! if you are never less loved than you are by
poor Theresa Allan, you will ne’er need to complain
for lack of loving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she burst into tears as she ended her rapid
speech; for she did not comprehend in the least at
what he was aiming, and her innocent and artless
heart was wounded by what she fancied to be a doubt
of her affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you feel so deeply the mere temporary
absence which my profession forces on me, Theresa,
how, think you, should you feel were that absence to
be eternal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eternal!” she exclaimed, turning very pale.
“Eternal! What do you mean by eternal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may well be so, Theresa; and yet it rests with
yourself, after all, whether I go or not—and yet be
sure of this, if I do go, I go forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With <span class='it'>me</span>—does it rest with <span class='it'>me</span>?” she cried, joyously.
“Oh! if it rests with me, you will not go at
all—you will never go any more. I am always in
terror while you are absent; and the west wind never
blows, howling as it does over these desolate bare hills,
with its mournful, moaning voice, which they say is
the very sound of a spirit’s cry, but it conjures up to
my mind all dread ideas of the tremendous rush and
roar of the mountain billows upon some rock-bound
leeward coast, as I have heard you tell by the <a id='cheer'></a>cheerful
hearth; and of stranded vessels, creaking and groaning
as their huge ribs break asunder, and of corpses weltering
on the ruthless waves; oh! such dread day-dreams!
If it rest with me, go you shall not, Durzil,
ever again to sea. And why should you? You have
won fame enough, and glory and wealth more than
enough to supply your wants so long as you live. Why
should you go to sea again, dear Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will <span class='it'>not</span> go again, Theresa, if such seriously be
your deliberate desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If such seriously be my deliberate desire!” the
fair girl repeated the words after him, with a sort of
half solemn drollery. Was it the native instinct of the
female heart, betraying itself in that innocent and
artless creature, scarcely in years more than a child—the
inborn, irrepressible coquetry of the sex, foreseeing
what was about to follow from the young man’s lips,
yet seeking all unconsciously to delay the avowal, to
protract the uncertainty, the excitement, or was it
genuine, unsuspecting innocence? “You are most
singularly solemn,” she continued, “this fine morning,
Durzil, wondrously serious and deliberate; and so, as
you are so precise, I must, I suppose, answer you likewise
in due set form. Of course, it is my desire to
have the company of one whom I esteem and love, of
one to whom I look up for countenance and protection,
of my only relative on earth, except my dear
old father, as much as I can have it, with due regard
to his interests and well-being. My father is getting
very old, too, and infirm; and at times I fancy that his
mind wanders. I cannot fail, therefore, to perceive
that he needs a more able and energetic person near
him than I am. I can, moreover, see no good cause
why you should persist in following so perilous and
stormy a profession, unless it be that you love it.
Therefore, as I have said, of <span class='it'>course</span>, if it rest with me
to detain you, I would do so—but always under this
proviso, that it were with your own good will; for I
confess, dear Durzil, that I fear, if you were detained
against your wish, if you still pant for the strong excitement,
the stormy rapture, as I have heard you call
it, of the chase, the battle, and the tempest, you never
could be happy here, whatever we might do to please
you. Now, Durzil, seriously and deliberately, you are
answered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could be happy here. I am weary of agitation
and excitement. I feel that I have erred—that the
path I have taken leads not to happiness. I want
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
tranquillity, repose of the heart, above all things—love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do not go—then I say positively, Durzil, dear
Durzil, stay with us—you can find all these here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure—all of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure? Why, if not here in this delicious, pastoral,
simple country, in this dear cottage, with its lovely
garden and calm waters, where in the world should
you find tranquillity, if not here, in the midst of your
best friends, in the bosom of your own family, where
should you look for love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa, there be more kinds of love than one—and
that I crave is not cold, duteous, family affection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, for the first time, it seemed that the young
man’s meaning broke clearly upon her mind; now a
sudden and bright illumination burst upon all that
seemed strange and wild and inconsistent in his conduct,
in his speech, in his very silence. Unsuspected
before, it was now evident to her at once that deep,
overmastering passion was the cause to which she
must refer all that had been for some time past to her
an incomprehensible enigma in her cousin’s demeanor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now that she was assured, for the first time in
her life, that she was really, deeply, ardently beloved—not
as a pretty, childish playmate, not as an amiable
and dear relative, but as herself, for herself, a lovable
and lovely woman, how did the maiden’s heart respond
to the great revelation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Elevated on the instant from the girl to the woman,
a strange and thrilling sense, a sort of moral shock
affected her whole system—was it of pleasure or
of pain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been often said, and I presume said truly, that
no woman—no, not the best and purest, the most modest
and considerate of their sex—ever receive a declaration
of love from any man, even if the man himself be
distasteful to her, even if the love he proffer be illicit
and dishonest, without a secret and instinctive sense of
high gratification, a consciousness of power, of triumph,
a pride in the homage paid to her charms, a sort of
gratitude for the tribute rendered to her sex’s loveliness.
She may, and will, repulse the dishonorable
love with scorn and loathing, yet still, though she may
spurn the worthless offering, and heap reproach upon
the daring offerer, still she will be half pleased by the
offer—if it be only that she has had the power, the
pleasure—for all power is pleasure—of rejecting it.
She may, and will, gently, considerately, sympathetically
decline the honest offers of a pure love which she
cannot reciprocate or value as it should be valued; but
even if he who made the tender be repulsive, almost
odious, still she must be gratified, perhaps almost
grateful for that which he has done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a young girl more especially, just bursting from
the bud into the bloom of young womanhood, scarce
conscious yet that she is a woman, scarcely awake to
the sense of her own powers, her own passions—a
creature full of vague, shadowy, mysterious fancies,
strange uncomprehended thoughts, and half perceived
desires, there is—there must be something of wondrous
influence, of indescribable excitement in the receiving
a first declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was with Theresa Allan. She was, in
truth, no angel—for angels are not to be met with in
the daily walks of this world—she was, indeed, neither
more nor less than a mere mortal woman, mortal in all
the imperfection, and narrowness, and feebleness, and
inability to rise even to the height of its own best
aspirations, which are peculiar to mortality—woman
in all the frailty and vanity and variety, no less than in
all the tenderness, the truth, the constancy, the loveliness,
the sweetness of true womanhood. She was,
in a word, just what a great modern poet has described
in those sweet lines,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“A creature not too bright or good</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;For human nature’s daily food;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;For transient sorrows, simple wiles,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and no one who is a true judge of human, and yet
more of woman nature will regret that she was such;
for he must be a poor judge indeed, he must know little
of the real character of womanhood, who does not feel
that one half of her best influences, one half of her
sweetest power of charming, soothing, controling,
winding herself about the very heart-strings, arises
from her very imperfections. Take from her these, and
what she might then be we know not, but she would not
be woman, and until the world has seen something
better and more endearing, until a wiser artificer can
be found than <span class='sc'>He</span> who made her, even as she is, a help
meet for man—away with your abstractions! give her
to us as she is, at least if not perfect, the best and
brightest of created things—a very, very woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard his words, she felt his meaning, yet the
sense of the words seemed to be lost, the very sounds
rang in her ears dizzily, her breath came so painfully
that she almost fancied she was choking, the earth appeared
to shake under her feet, and every thing around
her to wheel drunkenly to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed one hand upon her heart, and caught
her cousin’s arm with the other to support herself. Her
whole face, which a moment before had been alive and
radiant with the warm hues of happiness and youth, became
as white as marble. Her very lips were bloodless;
her whole frame trembled as if she had an ague fit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed on her in wonder, almost in terror. For a
moment he thought that she was about to faint, almost
to die; and so violent, in truth, was the affection of
her nerves, that, had she not been relieved by a sudden
passion of tears, it is doubtful what might have been
the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were standing when Durzil Bras-de-fer uttered
the words which had wrought so singular a change in
Theresa’s manner, within a pace or two of the sylvan
bower, of which she had spoken, and without a moment’s
pause, or a syllable uttered, he hurried her into
its quiet recess, and placing her gently on the mossy
seat within, knelt down at her feet, holding her left
hand in his own, and gazing up anxiously in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was amazed—he was alarmed. Not for himself
alone, not from the selfish fear of losing what he most
prized on earth—but for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew not, indeed, whether that strange and almost
terrible revulsion arose from pleasure or from pain.
He knew not, could not even conjecture whether it
boded good or evil to his hopes, to his happiness. But
the scales had fallen from his eyes in an instant. He
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
had discovered now, what her old father, recognizing
genius with the intuitive second-sight of kindred genius,
had perceived long before that this young, artless, inexperienced,
child-like girl, was, indeed, a creature
wonderfully and fearfully made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never before suspected that beneath that
calm, gentle, tranquil, unexciteable exterior there beat
a heart, there thrilled a soul full of the strongest capabilities,
the most earnest aspirations, the most intense
imaginings, that ever were awakened by the magic
touch of love, into those overwhelming passions, which
can tend to middle state, but must lead to the perfect
happiness or utter misery of their possessor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw it, he knew it now; and he felt that so
soon as the present paroxysm should pass over, she too
would feel and know all this likewise. Whether for
good or for evil, for weal or for wo, he perceived that
he had unlocked for her whom he truly and singly
loved, the hitherto sealed fountain of knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he almost shuddered at the thought of what he
had done—he almost wished that he had stifled his own
wishes, sacrificed his own hopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For though impetuous and impulsive, though in some
degree warped and perverted, he was not selfish. And
when he observed the terrible power which his words
had produced upon her, and judged thence of the character
and temper of her mind and intellect, a sad suspicion
fell upon him that hers was one of those over
delicate temperaments, one of those spirits too rarely
endowed, too sensitively constituted ever to know
again, when once awakened to self-consciousness, that
quietude in which alone lies true happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several minutes passed before a word was spoken
by either. But gradually the color returned to her lips,
to her checks, and the light relumed her beautiful blue
eyes, and the tremor passed away from her slight
frame; but her face continued motionless, and so calm
that its gravity almost amounted to severity. It was
not altogether melancholy, it was not at all anger, but it
was, what in a harder and less youthful face would
have been sternness. Never before had he seen such
an expression on any human face—never, assuredly,
had hers worn it before. It was the awakening of a
new spirit—the consciousness of a new power—the
first struggling into life of a great purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand lay passive in his grasp, yet he could feel
the pulses throbbing to the very tips of those small, rosy
fingers, so strongly and tumultuously, that he could not
reconcile such evidence of her quick and lively feeling
with the fixed tranquillity of the eye which was bent
upon his own, with the rigidity of the marble brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, and contrary to what is wont to happen,
it was he who first broke silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa,” he said, “I have grieved—I have pained—perhaps
offended you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she started, as his voice smote her ears, so
complete had been the abstraction of her mind, and
recovering all her faculties and readiness of mind on
the instant,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Durzil,” she said, very sweetly, but very
sorrowfully, “you have grieved me, you have pained
me, very, very deeply; but oh, do not imagine that you
have offended—that you could offend me. No; you
have torn away too suddenly, too roughly, the veil
that covered my eyes and my heart. You have
awakened thoughts, and feelings, and perceptions in
my soul, of whose existence I never dreamed before.
You have made me know myself as it were, better
within the last few minutes than I ever knew myself
before. It seems to me, that I have lived longer and
felt more, since we have sat here together, than in all
the years I can count before. And, oh, my heart! my
heart! I am most unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot love me, then, Theresa,” he said,
tranquilly; for he had vast self-control, and he was too
much of a man to suffer his own agitation or distress
to agitate or distress her further. “You cannot love
me as I would be loved by you—you cannot be mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Durzil,” she said, in tones full of the deepest emotion,
“until the moment in which you spoke to me, I
never thought of love, I never dreamed or imagined to
myself what it should be, other than the love I bear to
my father, to you, to all that is kind, and good, and
beautiful in humanity or in nature. But your words,
I know not how nor wherefore, have awakened me, as
it were, into a strange sort of knowledge. I do <span class='it'>not</span>
love, I almost hope that I never may love, as you would
wish me to love you; but I do feel <span class='it'>now</span> that I know
what such love should be; and I tremble at the knowledge.
I feel that it would be too strong, too full of
fear, of anxiety, of agony, to allow of happiness. Oh,
no, no! Durzil, do not ask me, do not wish me to love
you so; pray, rather pray for me to God rather, that I
may never love at all—for so surely as I do love, I
know that I shall be a wretched, wretched woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a strange scene, and it passed between a
strange pair. Great influences had been at work in the
minds of both within the last few hours, and it would
have been very difficult to say in which the greatest
change had been wrought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her, the tranquil, innocent, unconscious girl had
been aroused into the powerful, passionate, thoughtful
woman. A knowledge of that whereof she had been
most ignorant before “her glassy essence” had
awakened her, as the breeze awakens the lake from
repose into power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In him, the violent, hot-headed, stubborn, and impetuous
man of action had been tamed down by a conversion
almost as sudden and convincing into the slow,
self-controlled, self-denying man of counsel. As the
discovery of power had aroused her into life, so had
the discovery of long cherished, long injurious error,
tamed him into tranquillity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day ago he would have raved furiously, or
brooded sullenly and darkly over her words. Now,
even with the fit of passion all puissant over him, with
the wild heat of love burning within his breast, with
the keen sense of disappointment wringing him, he had
yet force of temper to control himself, nay, more,
he had force of mind enough to see and apprehend,
that <span class='it'>this</span> Theresa, was no longer the Theresa whom
he loved; and that, although he still adored her, it was
impossible either for him to meet the aspirations of her
glowing and inspired genius, or for her to be to him
what he had dreamed of, the tranquillizing, soothing
spirit which should pour balm upon his wounded,
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
restless, irritable feelings—the wife, whose first, best
gift to him should be repose and tranquillity of soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pressed her hand tenderly, and said, as he might
have done to a dear sister,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been to blame, Theresa. I have given you
pain, rashly, but not wantonly. Forgive me, for you
are the last person in the world to whom I would give
even a moment’s uneasiness. I did not suspect this,
dear little girl. I did not dream that you were so
nervous, or moved so easily; but you must not yield
to such feelings—such impulses, for it is only by yielding
to them that they will gain power over you, and make
you, indeed, an unhappy woman. You shall see,
Theresa, how patiently I will bear my disappointment—for
that it is a disappointment, and a very bitter one,
I shall not deny—and how I will be happy in spite of
it, and all for love of you. And in return, Theresa,
if you love poor Durzil, as you say you do, as your
true friend and your brother, you will control these
foolish fancies of your little head, which you imagine
to be feelings of your heart, and I shall one day, I doubt
not, have the pleasure of seeing you not only a very
happy woman, but a very happy wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are good, Durzil,” she said, tearfully and
gently. “Oh, you are very good and noble. Why—why
cannot I—” and she interrupted herself suddenly,
and covering her eyes with both her hands, wept
silently and softly for several minutes. And he spoke
not to her the while, nor even sought to soothe, for he
well knew that tears were the best solace to an over-wrought
over-excited spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little while, as he expected, she recovered
herself altogether, and looking up in his face with a wan
and watery smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not hurt, you are not wounded by what I
have done,” she said, “dear Durzil. You do not fancy
that I do not perceive, do not feel, and esteem, and
love all your great, and good, and generous, and noble
qualities. I am a foolish, weak little girl—I am not
worthy of you; I could not, I know I could not make
you happy, even if I could—if I could—if—you know
what I would say, Durzil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you could be happy with me yourself,” he answered,
smiling in his turn, and without an effort,
although his smile was pensive and sad likewise.
“No, my Theresa, I am not hurt nor wounded. I am
grieved, it is true, I cannot but be grieved at the dissipating
of a pleasant dream, at the vanishing of a hope
long indulged, long cherished—a hope which has been
a solace to me in many a moment of pain and trial, a
sweet companion in many a midnight watch. But I
am neither hurt nor wounded; for you have never
given me any reason to form so bold, so unwarranted
hope, and you have given me now all that you can give
me, sympathy and kindness. Our hearts, our affections,
I well know, let men say what they will, are
not our own to give—and a true woman can but do
what you have done. Moreover, even with the sorrow
and regret which I feel at this moment, there is mingled
a conviction that you are doing what is both wise and
right; for although you have all within yourself, though
you are all that would make me, or a far better man
than I, ay, the best man who ever breathed the breath
of life, supremely happy; still, if you could not be
happy with me, and in me yourself—how could I
be so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him again, and now, with an altered
expression, for there was less of sadness and more of
surprise, more of respect for the man who spoke so
composedly, so well, in a moment of such trial, on her
fair features. Perhaps, too, there might have been a
shadow of regret—could it be of regret that he did not
feel more acutely the loss which he had undergone?
If there were such a feeling in her mind—for she was
woman—it was transient as the lightning of a summer’s
night—it was gone before she had time even to reproach
herself for its momentary existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are astonished,” he said, interpreting her
glance, almost before she knew that he had observed
it, “you are astonished that I should be so calm, who
am by nature so quick and headlong. But I, too, have
learned much to-day—have learned much of my own
nature, of my own infirmities, of my own errors—and
with me to learn that these exist, is to resolve to conquer
them. I have learned first, Theresa, that my father,
whom I have ever been forced to regard as my worst
enemy, died conscious of the wrong he had done me—done
my mother—and penitent, and full of love and of
sorrow for us both. And therein have I convicted
myself of one great error, committed, indeed, through
ignorance, which has, however, been the cause, the
source of many other errors—which has led me to
charge the world with injustice, when I was myself
unjust rather to the world, which has made me guilty
of the great offence, the great crime of hating my
brother men, when I should have pitied them, and
loved them. Therefore I will be wayward no more,
nor rash, nor reckless. I will make one conquest at
least—that of myself and of my own passions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—I know,” said the girl, suddenly blushing
very deeply, “that you are every thing that is good
and great; every thing that men ought to admire and
women to love, and yet—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet you cannot love me. Well, think no
more of that, Theresa. Forget—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! never!” she exclaimed, clasping her hands
eagerly together. “I never can forget what you have
made me feel, what I must have made you <span class='it'>suffer</span>
this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if it be so, remember it, Theresa; but remember
it only thus. That if you have quenched my
love, if you destroyed my hope, you have but added to
my regard, to my affection. Promise me that whereever
you may be, however, or with whomsoever your
lot shall be cast, you will always remember me as your
friend, your brother; you will always call on me at
your slightest need, as on one who would shed his
heart’s blood to win you a moment’s happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—I will,” she cried affectionately, fervently.
“On whom else should I call. And God only knows,”
she added, mournfully, “how soon I shall need a protector.
But will you,” she continued, catching both
his hands in her own, “will you be happy, Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” he replied, firmly, returning the gentle
pressure, “I will, at least in so far as it rests with man
to be so, in despite of fortune. But mark me, dear
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Theresa, if you would have me be so, you can even
yet do much toward rendering me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I—then tell me, tell me how, and it is done
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By letting me see that <span class='it'>you</span> are happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” and again she clasped her hand hard over her
heart, as if to still its violent beating. “Alas! Durzil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why, alas! Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we be happy at our own will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Independently of great woes, great calamities,
which we may not control, which are sent to us for
wise ends from above—surely, I say, surely we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you, Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa, <span class='it'>this</span> is to me a great wo—yea, a great
calamity; and yet I reply, ay! after a time, after
the bitterness shall be overpast, I can, and more, I
will. Much more, then, can you, who have never felt,
who I trust and believe will never meet any such wo
or grief—much more can you be happy. Wherefore
should you not, foolish child—have you not been happy
hitherto? What have you, that you should not be
happy now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” she replied, faintly. “I have nothing
why I should be unhappy, unless it be, if I have made
you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa, you have not—you shall see that you
have not—made me unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet, Durzil, yet I feel a foreboding that I shall
be, that I must be unhappy. A want—I feel a want
of something here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are excited, agitated now; all this has been
too much for your spirits, for your nerves; and I think,
Theresa, I am sure that you are too much alone—you
think, or rather you muse and dream, which are not
healthy modes of thinking—too much in solitude. I
will speak to my uncle about that before I go—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before you go!” she interrupted him, quickly.
“Go, whither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To sea. To my ship, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you <span class='it'>are</span> hurt, then you <span class='it'>are</span> angry with me.
Then I have no influence over you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cease, cease, Theresa. It is better, it is necessary—I
must go for awhile, until I have weaned myself
from this desperate feeling, until I shall have accustomed
myself to think of you, to regard you as a sister
only; until I shall have schooled myself so far as to
be able to contemplate you without agony as not only
not being mine—but being another’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it—would it be agony to you, Durzil? Then
mark me, I never, never will be another’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madness!” he answered, firmly; “madness and
wickedness, too, Theresa. Neither man or woman
were intended by the great Maker to be solitary beings.
God forbid, if you cannot be mine, that I should be so
selfish as to wish your life barren, and your heart
loveless. No; love, Theresa, when you can, only love
wisely; and the day shall come when it will add to
my happiness to see and know you happy in the love
of one whom you can love, and who shall love you
as you must be loved. Never speak again as you
did but now, Theresa. And now, dearest girl, I
will leave you. Rest yourself awhile, and compose
yourself, and then go if you will to your good father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I—shall I tell him,” she faltered, “what has
passed between us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you will, as you judge best, Theresa. I am no
advocate for concealment, still less for deceit—but here
there is none of the latter, and to tell him this might
grieve his kind spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wise—you are good. God bless you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Theresa,” and he passed his arm calmly
across her shoulder, and bending over, pressed his lips,
calmly as a father’s kiss on her pure brow. “Fare
you well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going—going to leave us now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to-day—not to-day, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor to-morrow?” she said, beseechingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor to-morrow,” he replied, after a moment’s
hesitation, “but soon. Now compose yourself, my
dear little girl. Farewell, and God bless you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After scenes of great excitement there ever follows
a sort of listless languor; and, as in natural commotions
the fiercest elemental strife is oftentimes succeeded by
the stillest calms, so in the agitations of the human
breast, the most tumultuous passions are followed frequently,
if not invariably, by a sort of quiet which resembles,
though it is not, indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it was, that day, in the household of William
Allan. Tranquil and peaceful at all times, in consequence
of the reserved and studious habits of the
master of the house, and the deep sympathy with his
feelings and wishes which ruled the conduct of his
children—for Durzil was in all respects, save birth, the
old man’s son—that house was not usually without its
own peculiar cheerfulness, and its subdued hilarity,
arising from the gentle yet mirthful disposition of the
young girl, and the high spirits of Durzil, attuned to
the sobriety of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But during the whole of that day its quietude was so
very still as to be almost oppressive, and to be felt so
by its inmates. Allan himself was still enveloped in
one of those mysterious moods of darkness, which at
times clouded his strong and powerful intellect, as
marsh exhalations will obscure the sunshine of an
autumn day. Durzil was silent, reserved, thoughtful,
not gloomy or even melancholy, but—very unusually
for him—disposed to muse and ponder, rather than to
converse or to act. Theresa was evidently agitated
and perturbed; and although she compelled herself to
be busy about her domestic duties, to attend to the
comforts of the strange guests whom accident had
thrown upon their hospitality, though she strove to be
cheerful, and to assume a lightness of heart which she
was far from feeling, she was too poor a dissembler to
succeed in imposing either on herself or on those
about her, and there was no one person in the cottage,
from the old cavalier down to the single female servant,
with the exception of her father, who did not
perceive that something had occurred to throw an
unwonted shadow over her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
Jasper, alone perhaps of all the persons so singularly
thrown together, was himself. His age, his character,
his temperament, all combined to render him the last
to be affected seriously by any thing which did not
touch himself very nearly. And yet he was not altogether
what is called selfish; though recklessness, and
natural audacity, and undue indulgence, and, above all,
the evil habits which had grown out of his being too
soon his own master, and the master of others, had
rendered him thoughtless, if not regardless, of the feelings
of those around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the consequences of his accident, except the stiffness
and pain remaining from his contusions, had
passed away; and though he was confined to his bed,
and unable to move a limb without a pang, his mind
was as clear, and his spirit as untamed as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father, who had been aroused from the state of
indolence and sedentary torpor, which was habitual
rather than natural to him, by the accident which had
startled him into excitement and activity, had not yet
subsided into his careless self-indulgence; for the subsequent
events of the past evening, and his conversation
with Durzil on that morning, had moved and interested
him deeply; had set him to thinking much
about the past, and thence to ruminating on the future,
if perchance he could read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He by no means lacked clear-sightedness, or that
sort of worldly wisdom, which arises from much intercourse
with the world in all its various phases. He
was far from deficient in energy when aught occurred
to stimulate him into action, whether bodily or mental.
And now he was interested enough to induce him so
far to exert himself, as to think about what was passing,
and to endeavor to discover its causes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not, therefore, long before he satisfied himself,
and that without asking a question, or giving utterance
to a surmise, that an explanation had taken
place between the young seaman and Theresa, and that
the explanation had terminated in the disappointment
of Durzil’s hopes. Still he was puzzled, for there was
an air of tranquil satisfaction—it could not be called
resignation, for it had no particle of humility in its constituents—about
the young man, and an affectionate
attention to his pretty cousin, which did not comport
with what he supposed to be his character, under such
circumstances as those in which he believed him to
stand toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have looked for irritability, perhaps for
impetuosity bordering on violence, perhaps for sullen
moodiness—the present disposition of the man was to
him incomprehensible. And if so, not less he was unable
to understand the depression of the young girl,
who was frequently, in the course of the day, so much
agitated, as to be on the point of bursting into tears, and
avoided it only by making her escape suddenly from
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice, indeed, he caught her eyes, when she
did not know that she was observed, fixed with an expression,
to which he could affix no meaning, upon the
varying and intelligent countenance of his son—an expression
half melancholy, half wistful, conveying no
impression to the spectator’s mind, of the existence in
hers either of love or liking, but rather of some sort of
hidden interest, some earnest curiosity coupled almost
with fear, something, in a word, if such things can be,
that resembled painful fascination. Once too he noticed,
that not he only, but Durzil Bras-de-fer likewise,
perceived the glance, and was struck by its
peculiarity. And then the old cavalier was alarmed;
for a spirit, that was positively fearful, informed the
dark face and gleaming eyes of the free-trader—a spirit
of malevolence and hate, mingled with iron resolve
and animal fierceness, which rendered the handsome
features, while it lasted, perfectly revolting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That aspect was transient, however, as the short-lived
illumination of a lightning flash, when it reveals
the terrors of a midnight ocean. It was there; it was
gone—and, almost before you could read it, the face
was again inscrutable as blank darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought arose, several times, that day in the
mind of Miles St. Aubyn, that he would give much
that neither he nor his son had ever crossed the threshhold
of that house; or that now, being within it, it
were within his power to depart. But carriages, in
those days, were luxuries of comparatively rare occurrence
even in the streets of the metropolis; and in the
remote rural counties, the state of society, the character
of the roads, and the limited means of the resident
landed proprietors rendered them almost unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were not probably, within fifty miles of
Widecomb, two vehicles of higher pretension than
the rough carts of the peasantry and farmers; all journeys
being still performed on horseback, if necessary
by relays; even the fair sex traveling, according to
their nerves and capability to endure fatigue, either on
the side-saddle, or on pillions behind a relative or a
trusty servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until Jasper should be sufficiently recovered either
to set foot in stirrup, or to walk the distance between
the fords of Widecomb and the House in the Woods,
there was therefore no alternative but to make the best
of it, and to remain where they were, relying on the
hospitality of their entertainers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Durzil’s manner, it is true, partook in no degree of
the coloring which that transient expression seemed to
imply in his feelings; for, though unwontedly silent,
when he did speak he spoke frankly and friendly to the
young invalid; and more than once, warming to his
subject, as field-sports, or bold adventures, of this kind
or that, came into mention, he displayed interest and
animation; and even related some personal experiences,
and striking anecdotes, of the Spanish Main and
of the Indian islands, with so much spirit and liveliness,
as to show that he not only wished to amuse, but
was amused himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he was in this mood, he suffered it to escape
him, or to be elicited from him by some indistinct
question of the old cavalier, that he intended ere long
to set forth again on another voyage of adventure to
those far climes which were still invested with something
of the romance of earlier ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this hint, especially, that Miles St. Aubyn
observed Theresa’s beautiful blue eyes fill with unbidden
tears, and her bosom throb with agitation so tumultuous,
that she had no choice but to retire from the
company, in order to conceal her emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
And at this, likewise, for the first time did William
Allan manifest any interest in the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” he said, “what is that thou sayest, Durzil,
that thou art again about to leave us? Methought it
was thy resolve to tarry with us until after the autumnal
solstice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my resolve, uncle,” replied the young man
quietly, “but something has occurred since, which has
caused me to alter my determination. My mates,
moreover, are very anxious to profit by the fine
weather of this season, and so soon as I can ship
a cargo, and get some brisk bold hands, I shall set
sail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like not such quick and sudden changes,” replied
the old man; “nor admire the mind which cannot hold
to a steady purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark complexion of Durzil fired for a moment
at the rebuke, and his nether lip quivered, as though
he had difficulty in repressing a retort. He did repress
it, however, and answered, apparently without
emotion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a wise man, uncle, and must know that
circumstances will arise which must needs alter all
plans that are merely human. <span class='it'>L’homme propose</span>, as
the Frenchman has it, <span class='it'>mais Dieu dispose</span>. So it is
with me, just now. The changed determination which
I have just announced does not arise from any change
in my desires, but from a contingency on which I did
not calculate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It were better not to determine until one had made
sure of all contingencies,” said William Allan, sententiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, I think, one never would determine at all.
For, if I have learned aright, mutability is a condition
unavoidable in human affairs. But be this as it may,
the only change, I can imagine, which will hinder me
from sailing on the Virginia voyage, so soon as I can
ship a crew and stow a cargo, will be a change of the
wind. It blows fair now, if it will only hold a week.
One other change there is,” he added, as his fair cousin
entered the room with a basket of fresh gathered roses,
“which might detain, but that change will not come to
pass, do you think it will, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not, cousin Durzil,” she replied with a
slight blush, “if you allude to that concerning which
we spoke this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old knight looked from one to the other of the
young people in bewilderment. Their perfect understanding,
and extreme control of their feelings was beyond
his comprehension, and yet he could not believe
that he had mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, are you too against me, girl?” said her father
quickly. “Have you given your consent to his
going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My consent!” she replied, “I do not imagine that
my consent is very necessary, or that Durzil would
wait long for it. But I do think it is quite as well he
should go now, if he must go at all, particularly as he
intends, if I understand rightly, that it shall be his last
voyage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not promise that, Theresa,” said the sailor,
with a faint smile—“although”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not”—she interrupted him quickly—“I
thought you had; but it must be as you will,
and certainly it does not much concern me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the words, she left the room hastily, and
not as it appeared very well pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! see’st thou that?” cried her father—“see’st
thou that, Durzil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! do I.”—replied the young man with a good
deal of bitterness. “But I do not need to see that to
teach me that women are capricious and selfish in their
exigency of services.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dead pause. A silence, which in itself
was painful, and which seemed like to give birth to
words more painful yet, for William Allan knit his
brow darkly, and compressed his lower lip, and fixed
his eye upon vacancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment Jasper, whose natural recklessness
had rendered him unobservant of the feelings
which had been displayed during that short conversation,
raised himself on his elbow, and looking eagerly
at Durzil exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the Virginia voyage! To the New World!
My God! how I should love to go with you. Do you
carry guns? How many do you muster of your
crew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interruption, although the speaker had no such
intention, was well timed, for it turned the thoughts
and feelings of all present into a new channel. The
two old men looked into each other’s faces, and smiled
as their eyes met, and Allan whispered, though quite
loud enough to be audible to all present:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same spirit, Miles, the same spirit. As crows
the old game cock, so crows the young game
chicken!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not?” answered Durzil, with a ready
smile, for there was something that whispered at his
heart, though indeed he knew not wherefore, that it
were not so ill done to remove Jasper from that neighborhood
for a while. “If Sir Miles judge it well that
you should see something of the world, in these piping
times of peace, it is never too soon to begin. You
shall have a berth in mine own cabin, and I will put
you in the way of seeing swords flash, and smelling
villainous saltpetre, in a right good cause, I’ll warrant
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A right good cause, Durzil? and what cause may
that be?” asked his uncle in a caustic tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cause of England’s maritime supremacy,”
answered the young man proudly. “That is cause
good enough for me. For what saith bully Blake in
the old song—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘The sea, the sea is England’s, quo’ he again,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The sea, the sea is England’s, and England’s shall remain.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And he caroled the words in a fine deep bass voice, to
a stirring air, and then added—“That, sir, is the cause
we fight for, on the Line and beyond it—and that we
will fight for, here and every where, when it shall be
needful to fight for it. And now, young friend, to answer
your question. I do carry guns, eighteen as
lively brass twelve-pounders as ever spoke good English
to a Don or a Monsieur, or a Mynheer either, for
that matter; and then for crew, men and officers, I
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
generally contrive to pack on board eighty or ninety as
brisk boys as ever pulled upon a brace, or handled a
cutlas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you must reckon on high profits to venture
such an outlay,” said Sir Miles, avoiding the question
of his son’s participation in the cruise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay!” answered Durzil, “if no gold is to be had for
picking up in Eldorado, there is some to be gained
there yet by free-trading—and once in a while one may
have the luck to pick up a handful on the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the sea, ay! how so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I was going quietly along before the trades,
with my goods under hatches as peaceable and lawful
a trader, as need be, when we fell in with a tall galleon
careering. Having no cause to shun or fear her, I lay
my own course with English colors flying, when what
does she but up helm and after us. In half an hour she
was within range and opened with her bow guns, in
ten minutes more she was alongside, and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alongside, in ten minutes, from long cannon
range!” exclaimed Miles St. Aubyn—“what were you
doing then, that she overhauled you so fast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Running down to meet her, Sir Miles, with every
stitch of canvas set that would draw, when I saw that
she was bent on having it; and—as I was about to say
when you interrupted me—in twenty more she had
changed owners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! indeed! that <span class='it'>was</span> a daring blow,” said the
old soldier, rousing at the tale, like a superannuated
war-horse to the trumpet, “and what was she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A treasure galleon, sir; a Spaniard homeward
bound, with twenty-six guns, and two hundred men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did you with your prize, in peace
time? You hardly brought her into Plymouth, I should
fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor into Cadiz, either,” he replied with a smile.
“Her crew, or what was left of them, were put on
board a coaster bound for St. Salvador, her bars and
ingots on board the good ship ‘Royal Oak,’ of Bristol,
and she—oh! she, I think, was sent to the bottom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A daring deed!” said Sir Miles, shaking his head
gravely—“a daring deed truly, which might well cost
you all your lives, were it complained of by the Most
Christian King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet his supreme Christianity fired on us the
first!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet, that plea, I fear, would hardly save you
in these days, but you would hang for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” replied the young man. “Better be
hanged, ‘his country crying he hath played an English
part,’ than creep to a quiet grave a coward from his
cradle. And now, what say you, young sir, would
you still wish to adventure it with us, knowing what
risks we run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, by my soul!” answered the brave boy, with
a flashing eye, and quivering lip, “and the rather, that
I <span class='it'>do</span> know it. What do you say, father? May I go
with him? In God’s name, will you not let me go
with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, will I not, Jasper,” said Sir Miles, with an
accent of resolve so steady, that the boy saw at once
it was useless to waste another word on it. “Beside,
he is only laughing at you. Why! what in heaven’s
name should he make with such a cockerel as thou,
crowing or ere thy spurs have sprouted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laughing at me, is he!” exclaimed the boy, raising
himself up in his bed actively, without exhibiting the
least sign of the pain, which racked him, as he moved.
“If I thought he were, he’d scarce sail so quickly as
he counts on doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Durzil would have spoken, but the old cavalier
cut in before him, saying with a sneer,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is like thou could’st hinder him, my boy, at any
time; most of all when thou art lying there bed-ridden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The very reason wherefore I could hinder him the
easier,” replied Jasper, who saw by Durzil’s grave and
calm expression that the meaning his father had attached
to his speech, was not his meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how so, I prithee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had he, as you say he did, intended to mock me,
or insult me otherwise, I would have prayed him courteously
to delay his sailing until such time as my hurts
would permit to draw triggers, or cross swords with
him; and he would have delayed at my request, being
a gentleman of courage and of honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly I should,” replied Durzil Bras-de-fer,
“and you would have done very rightly to call on me
in that case. But let me assure you, nothing was further
from my intention than to laugh at you. I sailed
myself, and smelt gunpowder in earnest, before I was
old as you are by several years; and I was perfectly in
earnest when I spoke, although I can now well see
that my offer, though assuredly intended, could not be
accepted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Jasper had time to reply to these words, his
father said to him with a look of approbation,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have answered very well, my son; and I am
glad that you have reflected, and seen so well what
becomes a gentleman to ask, and to grant in such cases.
For the rest, you ought to see that Master Durzil Olifaunt
is perfectly in the right; and, that having offered
you courteously what you asked rashly, he now perceives
clearly the impossibility of your accepting his
offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not, however, see that at all,” answered the
boy moodily. “You carried a stand of colors, I have
heard you say, before you were fifteen, and you deny
me the only chance of winning honor that ever may be
offered to me, in these degenerate times, and under this
peaceful king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think that it would minister very much to
your honor, or add to the renown of our name, that you
should get yourself hanged on some sand key in the
Caribbean sea, or knocked on the head in some scuffle
with the Spanish guarda costas—no imputation, I pray
you believe me, Master Olifaunt, on your choice of a
career, the gallantry and justice of which I will not
dispute, though I may not wish my son to adopt it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not what you would have me do,” said the
boy, “unless you intend to keep me here all my life,
fishing for salmon and shooting black-cock for an occupation,
and making love to country girls for an
amusement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not aware, Jasper,” answered his father more
seriously than he had ever before heard him speak,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
“that this latter was one of your amusements. If it
be so, I shall certainly take the earliest means of bringing
it to a conclusion, for while it is not very creditable
to yourself, it is ruinous to those with whom you think
fit to amuse yourself as you call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not say that I ever had amused myself so,”
replied Jasper, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke of
his father—“though if I am kept moping here much
longer, heaven only knows what I may do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, no more of this!” said the old man
sharply. “You are not yet a man, whatever you may
think of yourself; neither, I believe, are you at all profligate
or vicious, although, as boys at your age are
apt enough to do, you may think it manly to affect
vices of which you are ignorant. But to quit this subject,
when do you think you shall sail, Master Olifaunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot answer you that, Sir Miles, certainly. I
purpose to set off hence for Plymouth to-morrow afternoon,
and, as I shall ride post, it will not take me long
ere I am on board. When I arrive, I shall be able to
fix upon a day for sailing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will return hither, will you not, before
you go to sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly I will, Sir Miles, to say farewell to my
kind uncle here, who has been as a father to me, and
to my little Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will pass one day I trust, if you may not
give us more, with Jasper at the Manor. We can
show you a heron or two on the moor, and let you see
how our long-winged falcons fly, if you are fond of
hawking. It shall be my fault, if hereafter, after so
long an interruption, I suffer old friendship, and recent
kindness also, to pass away and be forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come gladly to see my young friend here,
who will ere then be quite recovered from this misadventure;
and who, if he rides as venturesomely as he
fishes, will surely leave me far behind in the hot hawking
gallop, for though I can ride, I am, sailor-like, not
over excellent at horsemanship.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>NO. II.—THE LAST SACRAMENT.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY GIFTIE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even from his fairy-like and laughing boyhood,
George Atherton had been a dreamer. His soul seemed
like a harp whose chords were tuned in heaven, and
from which the rough winds of earth could draw forth
at best but a sad and broken melody. The spirit of
the Beautiful was given him at his birth, to be his constant
companion and unfailing friend. It walked with
him in his solitary rambles, it talked with him in his
lonely hours, it filled his dreams with high thoughts
and splendid imaginings. It led him to the solitude of
nature, and opened his eyes to behold the beauties of
this glorious creation, which even in rains bears the
stamp of the Divinity. And there, as his mind gradually
expanded, Religion came to him in the stillness of
life’s morning, and taught his fresh and unworn spirit
of the Highest and Holiest, by whom are all things, and
in whom all exist. To his child-like faith the Deity
was not a far off and incomprehensible mystery, but
an ever present all pervading spirit. In the thousand
voices that resound through this wide spread universe,
he heard an undertone—a low solemn voice, that said—“be
not afraid—it is I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then as the youth grew to manhood, wrapt in
these high and glorious communings with Nature and
his God, the love which had hitherto filled his soul
with an unuttered melody sprang like lightning to his
lips, and he stood up before the world to tell what the
spirit of God should whisper him of Christ and his love
to the lost and guilty—of heaven and its inconceivable
glories. But even into the holy religion which he
preached he carried the ever-present spirit of Poetry,
while he neglected not to expound in a simple manner
the truths of the gospel, it was plain that he loved better
to soar upward into the regions of the vast and terrible
unknown where sits the Omnipotent clothed in his own
infinity. He roamed the vast field opened by revelation,
and culled the fairest flowers and the richest treasures
that he might lay them with his heart’s devotion
a willing offering upon the altar of the Almighty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time went on, and a new class of emotions was
awakened in his breast. The love which before was
lavished on every thing beautiful in heaven or earth,
was turned into a new channel, centered upon one object;
and within his heart was a secret image that was
worshiped as second to naught save his God. The
moment that Emma came before him with her delicate
and ethereal loveliness, the spirit within him
whispered that that pale sweet face should be his destiny.
He listened to her voice and the echo of its
melody was thenceforth around him night and day, and
the very circumstance, that in a more worldly mind
would have quenched the first risings of affection by a
sense of its utter hopelessness, only served to draw him
more closely to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the brightness and in the gloom, in the sunshine
and beneath the radiance of the pale-browed queen of
night, since the gates of Eden closed on guilty man,
there has walked an angel over the earth. Amid the
green glades and flowery meads, beneath the mighty
forest trees and over the barren wastes, over the tossing
billows and within the crowded city, up the majestic
rivers and in the wild solitudes whence ariseth
the song of Nature untremulous and clear, has her footstep
passed and the light of her starry eye been seen.
In that “better land” she is the angel who waits without
the gate of the celestial city and opens it to the
holy and blessed ones who crowd thither. To them
she seems bright and beautiful, and her voice hath an
echo of the songs of heaven, but on earth she wears a
more sombre garb, and her eye hath a shade of gloom
far in its misty depths, and men call her the angel of
Death. This angel had for months been walking with
Emma, step for step, along the path of life, and sealing
with her icy touch the springs of existence. Before
George saw her, consumption had marked her for the
tomb. He knew it by the strange brightness of her
eyes and the hectic flush upon her cheek, and yet the
young pastor loved her</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood together beneath the free blue sunny
sky. His high brow was flushed, and his whole frame
quivered with the impetuous emotions that would no
longer be controlled, and even in their hopelessness
had uttered the words that might never be recalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened silently, and when at length she raised
her dark blue eyes to his they were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought well ere you told me this?”
she said in a low tremulous tone. “Know you that if
you would unite your fate with mine you must turn
from the glad pathway of life, and tread a dark lone
valley that leads to a shadowy bourne <a id='where'></a>where we must
part? Know you that the radiance of youth and health
has long since faded from my path, and of all my expectations
there remains but one—that one is Death—and
of all my hopes, only the hope of heaven. However
dearly you may love me, I can never be wholly
yours—even now I am wedded to another—I am the
bride of the Grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known it all—I have felt it all. I know
that love’s highest boon may be but to catch the last
look, the last sigh—yet even with this certainty that
love is dearer to me than ought else on earth. I ask
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
for nothing but to hear you say that I am beloved—I
dare expect nothing but to watch with you the fleeting
of the few months that remain to you on earth, and as
you stand beneath the portals of the grave to receive
one last assurance of undying affection as they close
between us—one promise that you will be mine—mine
still, in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I would not have it so,” said she musingly.
“Why should I throw the shadow of the tomb over
your path? Why should I chill your blood with the
cold touch of death? No, no, George, leave me, and
since you cannot forget, think of me but as an angel in
heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as she spoke her voice grew fainter and
fainter, and when she ceased she sunk upon his breast
exhausted by the struggle of feelings too strong for a
form so frail. He bent over her—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, only once, thou only beloved—only once
say that thou art mine,” he murmured in low thrilling
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her face, and their eyes met in a long
earnest gaze. Then slowly and tremblingly her white
lips opened—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thine, thine forever.”</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that she was dying day by day, and yet he
talked to his own heart of life and hope, as if he deemed
in the madness of his devotion that such love as theirs
would ward off death. And as time passed on we saw
his form grow thin, and his pale face yet paler, and his
dark eyes were dimmed as if he had looked too long
and earnestly into the darkness and tears that overhang
the grave. But she—there was a fierce and unnatural
glow upon her cheek that told of the deadly fire
within, and her step became slow and faltering, but the
clear light of her eloquent eyes grew brighter and
brighter as if she had looked through the gloomy clouds
of death upon the unspeakable glory of God, and in
gazing had forgotten how to weep. Thus in that hour
did the fair and fragile become the support of the
strong-hearted ones who, for her sake, were bowed to
the earth with sorrow. Her love was no summer
flower to wither beneath the shadows of the dark valley—and
they who wondered at its strength knew not
that it was fed with dews from the river of Life, and
nourished with the sunshine of the world beyond the
tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the day for the celebration of the sacrament
in our church at C⁠——, and at her earnest request
Emma was permitted to be with us on this occasion—perchance
the last for her on earth. For some time
she had been failing rapidly, and it was now evident
to all that her pilgrimage was nearly finished. She entered
when the afternoon service was over, walking
slowly between her aged and heart-stricken parents.
The young pastor did not lift his head, but sat with his
face buried in his hands till all was still again. He was
gathering strength to appear before the people of his
charge as became a minister of God, that he might not
appear to preach to them of a sustaining grace that had
failed to help him in his hour of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he arose his face was very pale, but all trace
of emotion had vanished. All human affection incompatible
with the Divine will seemed to have died
within him, and he stood calmly and firmly up, and
clasped his hands to pray. Long and earnest was that
petition, and its burden was the cry of a suffering
heart, “Not my will, oh God, but thine.” When it
was ended, then were distributed the emblems of the
sacred body that was broken, and the blood that was
shed for man’s salvation, and again the pastor rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he spoke in low tones of the Lamb of God
who gave himself to die for man, and of the efficacy of
that death; but his voice rose with the theme, his
eyes kindled, and his cheeks flushed as he proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I sat here, beloved friends, I have had communion
with the Father of Spirits. I seem to see the
blessed Redeemer on the night in which he was betrayed,
when he took the bread and brake it among his
disciples. I see his glorious yet mournful face as he
bade them keep this holy festival in memory of him.
He knew that before the next evening the Son of God
would have been laid, a bound and bleeding victim,
upon the altar of man’s transgressions. Ay! before
the morrow he must have offered up the atoning sacrifice
that was to take away the sins of the whole world—to
open the healing fountain whose waters should
mingle with the stream of Death and take away its
bitterness. He knew all the terrors of that fearful
night in the garden—the bloody sweat, the buffeting,
the ignominy, the agonizing death, were all before
him. Conceive his feelings as he sat among that chosen
band, as he met the earnest gaze of the loved one who
lay in his bosom, and heard the eager, tremulous question,
‘Lord is it I?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see him when the betrayer had left the disciples,
lead them forth into the garden, where even they who
had sworn to die for him could not watch with him one
hour—when as he knelt alone beneath the olive trees
he heard from afar the clash of arms and the shoutings
of the mob that came to take him. I hear the thrilling
agony of his mighty heart, as sinking beneath the
weight of a world’s iniquity, he cries—‘If this cup may
not pass from me, thy will be done.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scene is changed. Behold I see the clouds
parted and the veil which hides the awful future is
withdrawn. I see heaven opened, and he who agonized
in the garden and bled upon the cross, cometh
in the clouds, and with him those faithful ones who in
all ages of the world have feared not to follow him,
even unto death. The brightness of his Father’s glory
is around him, and the affrighted earth shrinks away
from his presence—‘Behold he cometh in the clouds,
and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced
him, and they shall wail because of him. And the
heavens shall depart as a scroll, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat—the sun shall be darkened and
the moon shall not give her light,’ and the whole earth
shall be offered as a burnt sacrifice to the terrible glory
of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shout then, ye little flock!—ye chosen ones from
the foundation of the world! Lift up your eyes to the
celestial city, and lo! the pearly gates are unbarred—enter
into Paradise, and join the choral hymn that is
chanted before the throne, for worthy is He who hath
redeemed you, to receive glory and endless praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
“The vision hath passed, but the voice of God
within me answereth, ‘He that overcometh shall inherit
the kingdom.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And oh! my brethren, what entire sacrifice of ourselves
should we give to him who for our sakes condescended
to become incarnate. What obstacle should
hinder us when we remember that such is our reward.
We journey on through this valley of sunshine and
tears, our hearts are fettered with the strong ties of
earthly love, and we joy and sorrow, hope and fear, as
do those who have no support but their own strength—that
broken reed that pierces the breast that leans on
it. But to our vision there is one bright spot, though
earth may be dim around us; there is one hope when
all other hopes fail, one refuge when tempests assail
us, one friend who will never die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pastor paused and gazed mournfully on the group
before him. Emma was sitting with her bright beautiful
eyes raised upward, while the smile on her parted
lips, and the rapt expression of her face, showed that
borne on the wings of faith, and the hope of that unutterable
glory, she had forgotten this mortal existence,
and was communing with her kindred angels. When
he spoke again, it was in a lower tone, and his voice
trembled slightly for he was but a man, and now that
the excitement had passed, his heart filled with a
boundless affection for that pale young creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And should not this hope comfort you, oh ye who
have so often been sorely tried, and who must now
again be called to look through tears up to your Father’s
throne, while she who leaves you tears the tendrils
of your hearts from earth, that she may fix them
with the grasp of an all-conquering faith upon the altar
of God. Mourn yet not, as comfortless—‘whom the
Lord loveth he chasteneth.’ Lift up your eyes from
this earthly dust to that celestial home where ye shall
dwell forever—‘in your Father’s house are many
mansions,’ and your Redeemer has said, ‘I go to prepare
a place for you.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke these last words a long, deep, thrilling
sigh, that seemed to bear upon it the anguish of a breaking
heart, broke from the mother’s lips, and drawing nearer
to Emma, she clasped her arms around her as if she
feared she would go even then from her embrace.
The action and the sigh drew Emma from the height
to which her sublime thoughts had soared. She turned
suddenly, and a change passed over her beaming face
as she looked upon her parents. Her father had bowed
his head upon his hands, and his aged frame shook
with suppressed sobs. Both had forgotten time, place,
every thing but that she was their last, their only one,
and the thought that came more than ever to their
hearts, that she must leave them. Emma wiped the
tears from her mother’s face and strove to speak, but
the reaction of feeling was too great for her feeble
frame to endure; she became violently agitated, a faintness
came over her, and starting from her seat, she fell
forward into her mother’s arms gasping for breath.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>Night, solemn and holy! How infinite was the
mercy that gave thee to spread thy star-spangled mantle
over the tired earth, hushing to repose its misery,
and hiding its crime. Night, pure and beautiful! The
fitting time for the soul of the innocent to ascend to a
better land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midnight had chimed on the old church clock, and
the whole world seemed sleeping as if bound by a
spell. The stars were looking down from the far off
heavens, and the large moon was sinking behind the
long low clouds in the west, gilding leaf and fountain
with its brightness, and shedding a holy radiance on
the face of the dying girl. Emma was reclining on a
low couch by the open window, and save the low
sighing of the wind all was still in that room of death.
The agony of suffering that all day had racked her
frame, was now passed away, and she lay in a calm
slumber, with her head upon her mother’s bosom.
George Atherton knelt beside the couch with her hands
clasped in his, and her father stood near, silent beneath
the pressure of a wo too deep for tears. The last hour
had come—they knew that she was dying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it not ever thus? The loveliest, the most utterly
beloved are ever the first to leave us. Those on whom
we most leaned for support and comfort during this
earth-pilgrimage are ever the first victims to the unerring
shaft of death. And <span class='it'>it is well</span>. Fondly as I have
loved and deeply as I have mourned for the dead, I feel
that it is well. “The branches are lopped off that the
tree may fail the easier.” The prop to which we clung
is torn away that the bleeding tendrils of these wrung
hearts may wind themselves more closely around the
Rock of Ages. The <a id='cord'></a>cords that bound the spirit to
earth are severed, that its flight may be unimpeded toward
that heavenly city, that New Jerusalem, where
God shall wipe away all tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How shall I tell of the parting—the <span class='it'>final</span> parting.
How shall mortal language describe the triumph of
stern relentless Death over the love of human hearts.
He who sitteth in his calm glory above the reach of
earthly sorrow—He to whose bosom that cherished
one is now departed—He alone can tell the anguish of
that trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left them. She who had been the sunlight of
their existence, turned from them, and meekly and
cheerfully trod the lone valley of Death. But she had
listened to “the spoken words,” she had caught a
glimpse of the glories of her heavenly home, she had
heard a faint echo of the harpings of an immortal hymn,
and she raised her eyes with glad faith to the throne of
the Eternal, and leaning on the arm of her beloved she
entered into her rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When morning came over the laughing earth, the
light looked into that still chamber tremblingly, as if it
feared to break the solemn gloom. Still they remained
there—those pale watchers beside the dead—and with
her head yet leaning on her mother’s breast, and a
faint smile upon her parted lips, lay the cold lifeless
form of the beautiful one who had gone from them forever.
That dying smile—it beamed upon their hearts
like sunlight from heaven. It was the seal of Love’s
triumph, of the soul’s immortality, and told of a reunion
beyond the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long did those aged and lonely parents survive
her. Gently and easily they were called unto their
celestial home. And for him who had so loved her—still
he wanders on the earth, working his Master’s
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
will, lonely yet not desolate. He shut his heart above
that deep and quiet sorrow, as above a shrine whose
lifeless ashes might never be rekindled by the fire of
earthly love. Of Emma and of her early death, few
ever heard him speak, but all who saw him, knew that
the hopes and affections which engross the heart of
man had been forever torn from his, and that amid
the changes of his career his calm soul lifted its
thoughts upward to the heaven of heavens where <span class='it'>she</span>
now dwells, with an eager and imploring cry—“how
long, oh Lord—how long.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OF THE INTRODUCTION OF DEATH, AND ORIGIN OF THE MEDICINE WORSHIP AMONG THE OGIBWAS.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY KAH-GE-GA-GAH-BOWH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of time which preceded the introduction
of death and evil into the country of the
Indians, is represented to have been one which the
most fanciful imagination might suggest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this late day the son of the forest speaks of it
with deep feeling, and sighs for its return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following was related to me in a wigwam in
which I spent about fifteen years of my early life. It
constituted a part of a lecture I received during the
ceremony of initiation into the order of the Mysterious
Worship of the Medicine Lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Keshamoradoo made the red men, he made
them happy. The men were larger, were fleeter on
foot, were more dexterous in games, and lived to an
older age than now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forest abounded with game, the trees were
loaded with fruit, and birds who have now a black
plumage were dressed with pure white. The birds
and the fowls ate no flesh, for the wide prairies were
covered with fruits and vegetables. The fish in the
waters were large. The Moredoo from heaven
watched the blaze of the wigwams’ fires, and these
were as countless as the stars in the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange visitants from heaven descended every
few days, and inquired of the Indians whether any
thing was wrong. Finding them happy and contented,
they returned to their high homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were tutelar gods, and they consulted with
the sages of the different villages, and advised all not
to climb a vine which grew on the earth, and whose
top reached the sky, as it was the ladder on which the
spirits descended from heaven to earth, to bless the
red men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these errand-spirits became intimate with
one of the young braves, who dwelt in a cabin with
his grandmother, and favored him with invitations to
stroll with it among the various villages around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The favor shown by this god to the young man produced
a jealousy among his brethren, and during the
absence of his distinguished friend, the favored one
was much troubled by his neighbors, who envied him
his situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one occasion when this persecution became intolerable,
he determined to leave his country, and, if
possible, accompany the spirit to the skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief men had enjoined on all the duty to refrain
from any desire or any attempt to ascend the vine
whose branches reached the heavens, telling them
that to do so would bring upon them severe penalties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spirit finding the young man quite sad, inquired,
learned the true cause of his sorrow, and taking him,
reascended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman cried for his return, “Noo-sis, be-ge-wain,
be-ge-wain.” “My child, come back, come
back!” He would not come home, and the woman
having adjusted all her matters in the lodge, after the
nightfall repaired to the vine and began to ascend it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the Indians found the lodge she had
inhabited empty, and soon espied her climbing the
vine. They shouted to her, “Hoision shay! ah-wos
be-ge-wain, mah-je-me-di—moo-ga-yiesh!” “Holloa,
come back, you old witch you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she continued ascending, up, up, up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A council was held to determine what inducement
could be made to her to return. They could hear her
sobbing for her grandson. “Ne-gah-wah-bah-mah
nos-sis.” “I will yet see my child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consternation and fear filled the hearts of the nation,
for one of their number was disobeying the Great Spirit.
Indignation and fury were seen in the acts of the
warriors, and the light of the transgressor’s burning
wigwam shed its lurid rays around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman was just nearing the top of the vine
which was entwined around one of the stars of heaven,
and about entering that place, when the vine broke, and
down she came, with the broken vine which had before
been the ladder of communication between heaven
and earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nations, as they passed by her, as she sat in the
midst of the ruin she had wrought, pushed her declining
head, saying, “Whah, ke nah mah dah bee
mage men di moo ya yilsh.” “There you sit, you
wicked old witch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some kicked her, others dragged her by her hair,
and thus expressed their disapprobation. All who
shall live after thee, shall call thee <span class='it'>Equa</span> (woman).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the disaster spread rapidly from village
to village. Soon numbers of men, women, and children
were singularly affected. Some complained of
pains in their heads, and others of pains in various
parts of their bodies. Some were unable to walk,
and others equally unable to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They thought some of these fell asleep, for they
knew not what death was. They had never seen its
presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep solemnity began its reign in all the villages.
There was no more hunting, no more games, and no
song was sung to soothe the sun to its evening rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, it was then a penalty followed transgression.
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
Disease was the consequence of the breaking of the
vine. Death followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, in the midst of their distresses, they consulted
each other to determine what could be done.
None knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They watched carefully for the descent of those
beings who used to visit them—and at length they
came. Eagerly each strove to tell his story. They
soon found that the strangers were silent and sad.
They asked the natives what words they wished to
tell the Great Spirit in their distress. One said that
the vine might be replaced. Another that the Great
Spirit might cause the disease to leave them. Another
wanted to kill the old woman. Another desired
plenty of game; and another wished the Great Spirit
to send them something that would cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this the strangers left, telling the Indians to
wait, and they should know what the Great Spirit
should say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each day of their absence seemed a month; at
length they came, and gathering around, the eager
people said to them that they must all die, as the vine
that connected earth to the skies was broken, but the
Great Spirit has sent us to relieve you, and to tell you
what you must do hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strangers then gathered all the wild flowers
from the plains, and after drying them on their hands,
blew the leaves with their breath, and they were scattered
all over the earth; wherever they fell they sprung
up and became herbs to cure all disease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians instituted a dance, and with it a mode
of worship. These few were the first who composed
the Great Medicine Lodge, and they did so from the
hands of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is not a flower that buds that is not for some
wise purpose, however small. There is not one blade
of grass that the Indian requires not. Learning this,
and acting in view of it, will be for your good, and
will please the Great Spirit.</p>

<p class='line0'>She laid her rosy palm in mine,</p>

<p class='line0'>And said, “Dear Harry, may I be,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='pindent'>The eve of All Saint’s Day is memorable in Scotland
as a time when the fairies hold a grand anniversary,
and when witches and evil beings are abroad on
errands of mischief. This superstition, modified in
various ways, finds a place also among the peasantry
of other nations. In the United States, Halloween
used to be observed by country maidens as a time for
trying sweethearts, and gaining such an intelligible
peep into futurity as would enable them to find out
whether they would be married or not; and if that
happy event was to crown their lives, who would be
the man of their choice. And even at this time,
“Hallow-Eve,” as it is called, is not suffered to come
and go without the effort of some loving maidens to
penetrate the mystery of their matrimonial future.
The modes of trying sweethearts, and the various
love tests applied, are curious enough. Burning nuts,
the love-candle, eating an apple before the looking-glass
at midnight, the salt egg, and dropping melted lead
through a key into a basin of water, are a few of them,
and all must be accompanied by particular ceremonies
or incantations, in order that they may have the desired
power to lift the veil of futurity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years ago we spent Halloween in the family
of a friend who resides fifty miles away from any large
town in the interior of Pennsylvania. He had three
marriageable daughters, who, it may be presumed, felt
as much interest in the great question of matrimony as
is usual in girls of their ages; and, on the occasion referred
to, something of what they thought and felt was
clearly enough displayed. One member of this family
was an old aunt, whose kind, gentle character and
cheerful disposition, made her a favorite with all.
She was a widow. Twenty years had gone by since
the grass became green over the grave of her husband.
She often referred to the past, but not in a spirit of
sadness or regret. And when she spoke of her husband,
the allusion seemed more to one who was living
than dead. And living, in fact, he was to her. The
deep affection that was in her heart, made him ever
present to her thoughts, and she lived in full confidence
of a re-union when she, too, should lay off the mortal
robes that enveloped her spirit, and rise into a true and
substantial life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be with Aunt Edith for half an hour, was to feel
toward her as toward an old friend. In less than that
time, on our first meeting, I was as much at home with
her as if we had been acquainted for years. For her
young nieces, Aunt Edith entertained the warmest
affection. It is doubtful if she could have loved her
own children more tenderly. She was ever ready to
take an interest in what interested them; and entered
into all their pleasures with a heartiness that made
them her own. On the evening to which I have referred,
as we sat pleasantly conversing before a bright
fire in the parlor, almost the first of the season, Aunt
Edith said, as if the thought had just occurred to her,
addressing, as she spoke, the oldest of her nieces,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Maggy, dear, this is Hallow-Eve. Have
you forgotten?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is!” cried Maggy, in return, clapping her
hands together with girlish enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallow-Eve!” chimed in Kate, the youngest of the
three. “Oh, we must try sweethearts to-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweethearts!” said Mr. Wilmot, the father of the
girls, in a grave voice. “Nonsense! Nonsense, child!
What do you want to know about sweethearts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate slightly blushed, but her smile was so radiant,
that it quickly extinguished the deeper hue that had
come over her bright, young countenance. She did
not, however, reply to her father’s question, but looked
into the face of Aunt Edith for encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait awhile, dear,” said Aunt Edith, “your
father don’t understand these matters. But I was a
young girl once, and know all about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trying sweethearts! Why I thought that custom
was peculiar only to the Scotch and Irish peasantry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Edith looked at me and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In cities,” she replied, “these customs are hardly
known, but here they have always prevailed among
portions of the people. Halloween, though not kept
with the formality attending the occasion in the rural
districts of Ireland or Scotland, is yet remembered by
hundreds of young maidens who live far away from
the great towns, and who improve the occasion to get,
if possible, a peep into futurity, and read therein an
answer to their heart’s eager questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it really be,” said I, in return, “that superstition
like this prevails in an age and among a people
so enlightened. Fortune-tellers would find a rich
harvest in these regions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not richer, I presume,” returned Aunt Edith,
“than among your more enlightened dwellers in
cities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, we have fortune-tellers and astrologers in
abundance, and they appear to find enough silly people
to encourage and support them. But what is the
nature of these love tests that so many of your country
maidens apply on Hallow-Eve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Edith smiled as she answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are of various kinds. Among the most
common is burning nuts on the hearth. A young
maiden will take two nuts, and naming one for the
man who is, or whom she would like to have for her
sweetheart, and the other for herself, she puts them in
the fire, and accordingly as they burn quietly together,
or start from beside one another, will be the future
relation toward each other by the lad and lassie.
Don’t you remember these verses in Burns’ “Halloween”:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were all listening with fixed attention, and
even Mr. Wilmot was interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, as I remarked,” continued Aunt Edith, “is
one of the commonest modes of trying sweethearts.
There are many others, and some of them involve
ordeals that would make the stoutest nerves quiver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever try any of them?” I inquired, half
forgetting myself in asking so pointed a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I have,” replied Aunt Edith, smilingly.
“A young maiden will go through a great deal, in
order to get some kind of an answer to a question that
so deeply involves her happiness. But you mus’n’t
expect me to make any confessions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, we wont ask that,” said I, “but you will
not object to relating some experiments of this kind
that you have known others make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. When I was a young girl, a great
deal more attention was paid to the Eve of All Saints’
Day than at present, and love-stricken lasses would
look forward for months for its arrival, in order to try
their sweethearts. You remember Lizzie Wells,
afterward Mrs. Jackson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well,” replied Mr. Wilmot, to whom the
question was addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never forget one of her attempts to raise the
spirit of her future spouse. Poor girl! It turned out
rather a serious matter for the time. She was a timid,
bashful thing, and was particularly sensitive when any
one jested with her about a sweetheart. It is usually
the case, that love charms are tried by at least two,
and sometimes three or four girls, in order that they
may brace up each other’s courage. But Lizzie had
no sister as a confidante, and there was no maiden of
her acquaintance to whom she would betray the
anxiety she felt on the momentous subject of love. So,
on Hallow-Eve she must try her sweetheart all alone,
or still remain in doubt. But doubt had pressed upon
her bosom until it could be borne no longer. As the
day that closed the month of October began to fade
into twilight, Lizzie’s resolution in regard to a certain
experiment, which had been strong when the bright
sun looked down from the sky, began to waver.
Clouds had heaved themselves up in the west, and the
cold autumn wind began to moan among the old forest
trees. The young girl felt a creeping shudder pass
through her frame, as her imagination pictured the
weird hour of midnight, and herself, alone, seeking
by strange rites to conjure up the spirit of her lover.
But the thought of one who, of all others she had yet
seen, embodied in her eyes the highest human perfections,
and the uncertainty that accompanied this
thought, brought her mind back again to its first resolution.
To have some sure knowledge on this subject,
was worth almost any trial, and the strong desire she
felt for its possession, nerved her heart for the
task she had laid upon herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As night closed in, the air became tempestuous.
The wind rushed and moaned through the trees that
were near and around her father’s dwelling. Every
window rattled, and the shutters and gates seemed as if
moved by some spirit-hands, for they were still scarcely
a moment at a time. Lizzie saw in all this disturbance
of the elements a sign that weird ones were abroad,
and you may well suppose that her heart trembled
when she thought of the experiment she was about to
make. When Hallow-Eve occurred just one year before,
she had tried one of the ordinary love charms;
but its indications were not satisfactory to her mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it?” asked Kate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The salt egg,” replied Aunt Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The salt egg?—what is that?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One or two, or more young girls, as the case may
happen to be,” said Aunt Edith, “sit up until the
witching hour of midnight. Then in the ashes they roast
each an egg, from which, after it is done, the hard yolk
is taken, and the cavity made in the egg by this removal,
filled with salt. Precisely at twelve o’clock at night, the
white of the egg is to be eaten with this salt, and then,
without drinking, the parties go to bed. Of course, they
get very dry in the night and dream of water, and, it is
averred that, in the dream, the spirit of the lover presents
a cup of water. If the damsel dream that she
takes the water and drinks it, the one by whom it is
presented will be her future husband; but if she refuse
to take it, she will not marry the man, and there are
chances in favor of her dying a maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever try the salt egg, aunty?” inquired
Kate, with an arch look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, child! Don’t ask your aunt such a
question,” said Mr. Wilmot, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear,” was the good-humored reply. “I’ve
tried that charm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how did it come out?” asked Maggy, and
Jane both at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” returned Aunt Edith, while a beautiful
smile played about her features. “Well,” she continued,
“as I was saying, Lizzie had tried the salt
egg, but it had not proved so satisfactory as she had
desired, and she resolved to work out a deeper charm,
and to interrogate the future by a more earnest rite.
What this should be, had for many days been a subject
of debate in her mind. The most certain spell
was that of the south running spring or rivulet. But
not within half a mile was there such a stream in the
right location. To make this trial of sweethearts a
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
sure one, the person must go after dark, to a stream
running south, and just where three estates meet, dip
the left sleeve in the water. She must then sleep in a
room where <a id='there'></a>there is a fire, and on going to bed, hang
the garment with the wet sleeve to dry. Of course,
she must lie awake until midnight, at which time the
spirit of the future husband will enter the room, go up
to the fire, turn the sleeve as if to dry the other side,
and then go away again. But, as I said, this ceremony
was out of the question, for Lizzie, even if her nerves
would have been strong enough for the trial, there
being no southward running spring within a convenient
distance. Other plans were next debated, and the final
conclusion was to eat an apple before a looking-glass,
just as the clock struck twelve, in the hope of seeing
the apparition of her spouse to be, looking at her over
her shoulder. At first thought this may seem but a
little matter, but let any one try it, and she will find
her courage put to a severe test.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“A dozen times, as the lonely evening passed away
and Lizzie hearkened to the troubled roar of the storm
without—for the rain had begun to fall—did her heart
fail her. But the intense desire she felt to know something
certain in regard to her lover, brought back her
wavering resolution. There was no one at home but
her father and mother, and they retired to bed, as was
their usual custom, about nine o’clock. Three hours
yet remained before the all-potent love test could be
tried, and there was full time for Lizzie’s already
weakened nerves to become sensitive to the utmost
degree. In order to make the time pass less wearily,
she took up some work and tried to sew. But her hand
was so tremulous that she could not hold the needle,
and after a few trials, she was forced to abandon the
attempt. She next tried to read, but with no better
success. Her eyes passed from word to word over
the open page, but there was not the slightest connection
between the words in the book and the ideas that
were passing through her mind. Half an hour was
spent in this way, and then, startled by a noise as of
some one trying to open the outside door, she looked
up and listened intently, while her heart throbbed so
heavily that she could distinctly hear every pulsation,
and feel them as strokes upon her bosom. As she
listened, other sounds became apparent. There was
the noise, as of feet, walking around the house; voices
were heard in the moaning wind, and cries from the
distant forest. Now, there seemed to be a knocking
at the window-pane, and she half turned herself to
look, her heart shrinking lest some fearful apparition
should meet her eyes. Even in the room the deep
silence was broken by strange sounds—something
rustled in one corner, and rattled in another; and even
the fire blazed on the hearth with an unearthly murmur,
while the sparks flew suddenly out, and darted
across the room as if instinct with some living
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus it was that the hours crept slowly on. But
still firm to her purpose, Lizzie, though her heart was
almost paralyzed with superstitious fear, kept her
lonely vigil. At length the clock, which had ticked
with a louder and louder noise as time wore on toward
midnight, pointed to the minute mark before twelve.
Up to this tone the storm without had been steadily
increasing. But now there came a sudden lull in the
tempest, and the roar of the wind sunk into a low,
sobbing moan, that sounded strangely human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hour had come. Upon the table by which
Lizzie sat, stood the candle, and near it the apple
which must be eaten as a part of the spell that was
to raise the spirit of her lover. Strongly tempted was
Lizzie, at this crisis, to rush from the room and
abandon the bold experiment. Both hands of the
clock would be on the point that marked the close
of Halloween in a few seconds, and if she did not act
now, the secret she so ardently desired to penetrate
would still be hidden from her eyes. She felt awful
in that moment of deep suspense. Her heart ceased
for an instant to beat, and then bounded on again in
troubled throbbings. Then, with a kind of desperate
energy, she caught up the candle and apple, and turned
to the glass that hung against the wall. As she did
so, the brief lull in the tempest expired, and the wind,
as if it had gained new power, rushed past with a
wilder sound, and shook the house to its very foundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One glance into the mirror, as the hammer of the
clock began to fall sufficed. A wild scream, thrilling
through the house, accompanied by a noise as of
some one falling heavily, aroused the sleeping parents.
When they descended to the room below, they found
Lizzie prostrate on the floor in a state of total insensibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, aunt!” exclaimed Kate, in a husky voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she see?” asked Maggy, who had been
listening with breathless attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was many hours before the frightened girl
came back to consciousness,” said Aunt Edith. “I
saw her on the day afterward, and she looked as if
she had been sick for a month. We were intimate,
and on my asking her some questions, she told me what
she had done, and avowed that, as she looked into the
glass, she distinctly saw the face of a man peering over
her shoulder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you didn’t believe her,” said Mr. Wilmot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she know the person whom she saw?” asked
Maggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She told me who it was; and they were
afterward married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mr. Wilmot. “I’m really
surprised at you, sister! You will turn these silly girls’
heads. You surely don’t believe that she saw any
face in the glass besides her own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In imagination she did, without doubt. The fact
of her fainting from alarm shows that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you say, Aunt Edith, that she afterward married
the person she saw?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear. But that is no very strange part of the
story. Young ladies are not famous for keeping secrets,
you know. I told a young friend, in confidence, of
course, what Lizzie had told me. She, though bound
to secrecy, very naturally confided the story to her
particular friend and confidante, and so it went, until
the young man came to hear of it. It so happened that
both he and Lizzie were rather modest sort of young
people, and, though mutually in love with each other,
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
shrunk from letting any signs thereof become manifest.
At a distance the young man worshiped, scarcely
hoping that he would ever be, in the eyes of the maiden,
more than a friend or acquaintance. But, when he
heard of the love test, and was told that his face had
appeared to the maiden, he took courage. The next
time he met Lizzie, he drew to her side as naturally
as iron draws to the magnet; and as he looked into her
mild blue eyes, he saw that they were full of tenderness.
The course of true love ran smoothly enough
after that. On next Halloween they were made one,
in the very room where, a year before, the never-to-be-forgotten
love charm was tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next morning neither of the sisters were very
bright. Maggy was pale; Jane did not make her appearance
at the breakfast table, and Kate looked so
thoughtful as she sipped her coffee with a spoon, and
only pretended to eat, that her mother inquired seriously
as to the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate blushed, and seemed a little confused, but said
nothing was the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you have not been so silly as to try sweethearts,”
remarked Mr. Wilmot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the tell-tale blood mounted to the brow of
Kate. Maggy, likewise, found her color, and rather
more of it than her cheeks were wont to bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why girls!” exclaimed the father, who had spoken
more in jest than in earnest. “Can it be possible⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, before he could finish the sentence, both Kate
and Maggy had risen from the table—their faces like
scarlet—and were hastily leaving the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said Mr. Wilmot, “I thought better of
them girls! What nonsense! This is all your fault,
sister. I shouldn’t at all wonder if you were up with
them trying <span class='it'>your</span> sweetheart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Edith smiled, in her quiet, self-possessed way,
as she replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly think, brother, you will find it any thing
more serious than eating a salt egg on going to bed, or
some trifling affair like that; for which I can readily
excuse a young maiden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To think they should be so weak as to believe in
nonsense of this kind!” said the father. “I hoped
that my daughters had better sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take the matter so seriously, brother,” replied
Aunt Edith to this. “It has only been a little
frolick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been rather a serious one, I should think, to
judge from the effects produced. Jane, I presume, is
too much indisposed to get up; and I am sure both
Maggy and Kate look as if they had been sick for a
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll all come out bright enough before noon.
Don’t fear for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls, however, were not themselves again
during the whole day. Jane’s absence from the breakfast
table was in consequence of a nervous headache,
from which she suffered nearly all day. And Kate
and Maggy continued to look thoughtful, and to keep
as much away from the rest of the family as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It out, before night, that each of the girls, on
retiring at twelve o’clock, had eaten a “salt egg.” The
consequence to Jane was a sick headache; and the
others did not feel much better. As to their dreams,
they wisely kept their own counsel. That these had
some effect upon their spirits, was, no doubt correctly,
inferred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That a young girl, after sitting up until twelve
o’clock at night, thinking of a certain nice young man,
and then eating half a cupfull of salt, should dream
that she was thirsty, and that this certain young man
came and offered her water to drink, is not a very
wonderful occurrence, and might be accounted for
on very natural principles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” replied Aunt Edith, to whom the remark
was made, as we sat, all but the girls, conversing
before the parlor fire on the evening of that day.
“And yet I have known of cases where the dreams
that came were singularly prophetic. As for instance.
A young friend of mine, when I was a girl, tried,
though under engagement of marriage, this experiment.
She dreamed that her lover came and offered
her water, and that she declined taking it, which is
considered an unfavorable omen. In a month afterward,
although the time for the wedding was fixed,
the young man deserted her for another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All that may have occurred,” said Mr. Wilmot,
“without there being any connection between the
dream and the after event.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, certainly. Yet you must own that the coincidence
was a little singular,” returned Aunt Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are hundreds of coincidences occurring
daily that are far more remarkable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true. But will you say positively that indications
of things about to occur are never given?
That no shadow of a coming event is ever projected
upon our pathway as we move through life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I do not <span class='it'>know</span>, positively, any thing on the
subject, I will assert nothing. But, as a general principle,
we are aware that Providence wisely withholds
from us a knowledge of the future, in order that we
may remain in perfect freedom. If the knowledge of
future events was given, our freedom would be destroyed,
for the certainty of approaching calamity, or
favorable fortune, would destroy our ability to act
efficiently in the present. And as, for so good a reason,
our Creator draws a veil over the future, I think
it wrong for us to use any means for the removal of
that veil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To any one,” replied Aunt Edith, “whose mind
is as clear on this subject as yours, all seeking after
future knowledge would be wrong. But all are not so
enlightened. All have not the intelligence or ability
to think wisely on Providence and its operations with
men. To such, in their weakness, the kind Providence
that withholds as a general good, may grant
particular glimpses into the future, as the result of certain
forms which may determine spiritual influences;
as was the case in ancient times, when oracles gave
their mysterious answers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid, sister,” said Mr. Wilmot, “that you
have a vein of superstition in your character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Aunt Edith. “I believe I am as
free from superstition as one need wish to be. But I
look upon the operations of Providence with man as
designed for his spiritual good, and as coming down
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
to meet him even in his lowest and most ignorant
state, in order to elevate him. There may be a condition
of the human mind that needs, for its aid, some
sign from the world of spirits; and wherever that
state exists, such signs will be given. In the barbarous
times of any nation, we find a belief in supernatural
agencies—in signs, tokens, and oracles—a prominent
characteristic. This is not so much an accidental circumstance
as a Providential arrangement, by which
to keep alive in the mind the idea of a spiritual world.
The same is true among the <a id='unen'></a>unenlightened classes at the
present day; and the reason is of a similar character.
To people who know no better than to seek, by certain
forms, to penetrate the future, true answers may
be permitted sometimes to their inquiries; and this for
a higher good than the one they are seeking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point in the conversation the young ladies
came into the room, and the subject was changed.
During the evening allusion was again made to the
topic upon which so much had already been said,
when, in answer to some question asked of Aunt Edith,
she related the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before I was married,” said she, “there was a
certain young man who paid me many attentions, but
whom, from some cause or other, I did not particularly
fancy. He was an excellent young man, of a good
family, and, as sober and industrious as any one in the
neighborhood. Still, for all this, I felt more like repulsing
than giving him encouragement. He saw that
I avoided him when I could do so without appearing
rude, and this made him more distant; yet I could see
that his mind was on me. I would often meet his
eyes when we were in company; and he would come
to my side whenever he could do so without appearing
to be intrusive. His many excellent qualities, and the
manliness of character for which he was distinguished,
prevented me from treating him otherwise than respectfully.
As a friend, I liked him, but when he approached,
as was evidently the case, in the character
of a lover, I could not be otherwise than cold and reserved.
There were two or three other young men
who appeared fond of my company, any one of whom
I would have accepted, had he offered himself, in preference
to this one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such was the state of my love affairs, when Halloween
came round. A cousin, a young girl about
my own age, was spending a few weeks in our family,
and she and I talked over the matter of trying sweethearts.
After looking at the subject in its various
lights and shades, we finally determined to summon up
the requisite courage, and burn a love-candle. So,
after all the family were in bed, which was not until
after eleven o’clock, we began to make preparations
for this ceremony. Burning the love-candle is done
in this way. A table is set with bread, cakes and
fruit; or any other articles of food that may be selected.
Plates for as many guests as are expected are
also put upon the table; but no knives or forks, lest
the guests should, by any accident, harm themselves.
A little before midnight a candle, in which a row of
nine new pins have been placed just below the wick,
is lighted and set upon the table. The distance between
the row of pins and the burning end of the
candle must not be greater than will melt away by the
time the hour of twelve strikes. When the candle
burns down to the pins, they drop one after the other,
and just as the last one falls, the apparitions of the
future husbands of those who try the charm will enter,
it is said, sit down to the table and eat, and then rise
up and go away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Lydia and I determined that we would try
this love charm; so we arranged our table, placed
upon it the candle in which were stuck the row of
nine new pins, and sat down to await the arrival of
the hour that was to open for us a page of the future.
I shall never forget the deathlike stillness that reigned
for a time through the room; nor how I started when
the old house-dog suddenly raised, almost under the
window, a long, low, melancholy howl. My heart
seemed to beat all over my body, and I could feel the
hair rising on my head. After a quarter of an hour
had elapsed, we lit the candle and returned to our
seats on the opposite side of the room to that in which
the table was standing, almost crouching down in our
chairs. As we did so, one of the shutters, which was
merely drawn to without being fastened, flew open
suddenly, and was slammed back against the side of
the house, at the same time the wind began rushing
and moaning through the trees. I felt awful. Spirits
seemed all around me, and I looked every moment for
some fearful apparition to blast our sight with its
presence.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Steadily the hand passed from point to point, and
from figure to figure on the dial of the clock, my feelings
becoming more and more excited every moment.
At last came the warning that is given just before the
striking of the hour, and the minute hand had but a
point or two to pass before it was on the sign of twelve.
My very breath was suspended. A few moments
more, and then the hammer of the clock fell, and each
stroke appeared as if made upon my heart. Suddenly
there came a rush of wind past the house, and
strange, wild, mournful tones it made; then the
door swung open, and in came the apparition of a
man. I saw in an instant that it was the one of whom
I have spoken. His face had a fixed, dreamy, and, it
seemed to me, troubled expression. He went up,
slowly, to the table, and sitting down at my plate, took
some fruit. For the space of nearly a minute it seemed
to me, he remained there motionless; but did not eat.
Then rising he turned away and left the room. During
the brief period he remained, he manifested not the
slightest consciousness of our presence. You may be
sure we did not remain long after he had retired, but
went tremblingly up stairs, half frightened out of our
wits, and buried ourselves beneath the clothes without
stopping to remove our garments, where we lay and
shivered as if both of us had ague fits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sure enough,” continued Aunt Edith, “it
turned out as the sign had indicated. I was married
to the young man, and my cousin died an old maid.
It was all folly I thought to struggle against my fate,
and so from that memorable ‘Hallow-Eve’ received
my lover’s attentions with favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And were you so weak as to believe that any one
did really come in?” said Mr. Wilmot.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
“I was,” returned Aunt Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all your imagination,” said the brother,
positively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I believe not. I don’t think it was possible
for both of our eyes to be deceived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then your cousin saw it too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she would have averred, had you asked her
the day before her death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wilmot shook his head; while the girls looked
credulous. I noticed that Kate glanced slightly around,
every now and then, half fearfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day,” resumed Aunt Edith, “about two years
after our marriage, something favoring an allusion to
the subject, I said to my husband—‘There is one thing
that I never could bring myself to mention, and I
hardly like to do it now.’ ‘What is that?’ he asked.
I then related to him, minutely, all that I have told
you this evening. He looked grave, and was thoughtful
for some time. Then he said—‘And there is also
one thing about which I have never felt free to speak
to you. I remember that night well, and shall have
cause to remember it as long as I live.’ ‘Were you
conscious of any thing?’ I asked eagerly. ‘Yes, of a
great deal,’ he replied. ‘I saw, in fact, all that passed.’
‘In a dream?’ said I. ‘No, while awake—as fully
awake as at this time. To throw off all disguise, and
speak without mystery, I happened on that night to be
going home at a late hour, and in passing your house
saw a light streaming through a small opening in the
shutter. It instantly occurred to me that you might
be up and engaged in some love experiments, as it was
Hallow-Eve; so, stealing up softly, and peeping in, I
saw that I was not in error. No very long time was
spent in determining what to do. My decision I
marked by suddenly jerking the shutter back, and
slamming it loudly against the house. Concealed by
the darkness, I perceived the effect of this. It was
what I had anticipated. You did not in the least suspect
the truth. As plainly as if I had been in the room,
I could now see all that was passing; and, as I understood
the particular charm you were trying, knew
precisely what part I was to act in the ceremony. So,
as I had all along believed myself to be the favored
one, although you somehow or other appeared to think
differently, I took the liberty of walking in, just as the
clock struck twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this part of Aunt Edith’s story she was interrupted
by a burst of laughter from all in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so that was the explanation of the great mystery?”
said Mr. Wilmot. “The troubled spirit was a
real flesh and blood visiter after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And in my heart I forgave him for the trick
he played off upon me so adroitly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Aunt Edith!” exclaimed Maggy, taking a
long breath. “How you frightened me! I really
thought it was a spirit that had entered!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child. Spirits, I believe, are not apt to walk
about and visit love-sick maidens, even on Halloween,
for all that may be paid to the contrary. The instance
given you is the best authenticated I have ever
known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This relation furnished abundant food for merriment,
as well as for some sage reflections during the evening,
and even Maggy, Jane and Kate saw reason to join
with the rest in laughing over the folly of Love Tests
at Halloween.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MISS M. J. B. BROWNE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The village of N., reader, where the scene of my
story is laid, is truly a most lovely place, so far certainly
as Nature is responsible; for a broad, beautiful
river bounds it on one side, and a fine range of mountains,
picturesquely grand, screen it on another.
Wealth, too, has joined hands with Nature to assist in
the perfect completion of what <span class='it'>she</span> had left as it were
unfinished. Sweet cottages nestling in green shrubbery,
and elegant mansions surrounded by spacious
gardens and lawns, glistening with fountains or shady
with groves, reveal to the beholder a harmonious conspiracy
between taste and affluence to picture Paradise
in daguerreotype—everything must be in daguerreotype
in these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the <span class='it'>moral</span>—perhaps it would be more charitable
to say the <span class='it'>conventional</span> aspect of the village, is not so
lovely as the natural aspect. A certain line of distinction
has been drawn in society, and has long been assuming
a greater and greater stringency, as an old
generation passes away, and a new one refining upon
its ancestor succeeds it. It is not the aristocracy of
family and birth—the pride of nobility, as in England—nor
the aristocracy of wit and talent, as in France—nor
yet the true aristocracy of intellect and moral worth—but
the peculiarly American aristocracy of money!
Caste, determined by the possession or non-possession
of estates and bank-stock, is scarcely more rigidly
guarded on Hindoo ground than here—and intermarriages
between the “higher and lower classes”—ridiculous
names it is true, to be applied to society in
republican democratic America—are regarded as sufficient
reason for casting off all association with the <span class='it'>degraded</span>
party, whatever rank said party may have sustained
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here I cannot forbear a passing remark on the
obvious inconsistency of this principle. The accidents
of fortune are so very variable, and its mutations such
matters of every day experience, that a more fluctuating
or uncertain standard of station could not possibly have
been chosen. The possessor of half a million to-day,
in a few years may die alone and in penury, the miserable
tenant of a deserted garret, while the ragged,
shivering, homeless boy, who pays his last hardly
earned copper for the privilege of sleeping on an untenanted
board, may at length find himself in the enjoyment
of the “highest honors in the gift of his country-men,”
the honorable master of thousands, with a once
starving and outcast beggar child the sharer of his
emoluments and the elegant mistress of his mansion.
The <span class='it'>son</span> of the rich man may die unknown and unblessed
in the prison or the almshouse, “while the son
of the maid servant who cleaned the President’s
kitchen,” may be carried to the “white house” in
triumph, the chief magistrate of a great and powerful
nation. But pardon my <a id='digr'></a>digression, dear reader—I
needed not to <span class='it'>pen your own sentiments</span>. It is time I
should introduce you to some of my people, if I would
interest you, as I hope I may, in their acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “first and best” lady in the village of N. was
Mrs. Josepha Tower. This lady was a widow, and
in every respect, in heart, and mind, and manners, she
was a truly elegant and accomplished woman. She
belonged in a measure to the “old school,” and she
possessed an uncommon share of sterling common
sense, and the firmest and most uncompromising Christian
principle. She was the possessor, too, of ample
wealth, and diffused it with a liberality which reflected
honor on her generosity, as well as poured a stream of
happiness into her bereaved and widowed heart. The
earlier part of Mrs. Tower’s life had been passed in a
Southern city, though she was proud to claim a birth-right
on New England’s soil, and an affinity with the
upright and earnest New England heart in her purposes
and dispositions. When the cholera with pestilential
breath swept over the city of C⁠——, it numbered
among its victims her husband and her only child; and
as the staff and centre of her hopes were thus suddenly
cut down at a single stroke, Mrs. Tower turned her
face toward the home of her childhood, and sought
amid the green hills and quiet streams, where those
fresh and careless years had been passed, for that alleviation
to her sorrows which she must have sought in
vain among scenes where her irreparable losses would
be constantly suggested by contact and association.
She came forth from the furnace of her affliction like
gold seven times purified, and resolutely declining even
the consideration of a second marriage while her heart
was bound so fast in its wedlock to the grave, she
consecrated her influence and her wealth to the noble
purpose of promoting the well-being and the happiness
of her fellow sojourners in a wilderness world. The
star of her hope had gone out while she yet watched it
in midheaven, and why should she not henceforward
bind herself to the unselfish aim of spreading abroad
the joy which had taken its flight from her own bosom,
leaving in its place a calm and holy resignation? So
to the north and to the south, to the east and to the
west, “from the river to the ends of the earth,” flowed
the rills, all fresh and fertilizing, which found their reservoir
in her kindly and world-embracing benevolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every thing tasteful and elegant in the matter of
household appointments, was always to be found at
Mrs. Tower’s. Books, not laid upon the shelves of
her library merely to dazzle by their gilding, but to be
read by every body who would read—pictures and
statues—for she was a generous patroness of the arts—music
and flowers, and the most refined and polished
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
society, were among the most familiar attractions one
always found at the residence of that excellent lady;
and yet I tell my readers only the truth when I say
that with all her wealth, and her truly enviable social
position, Mrs. Tower was the only woman in the whole
circle of N. <a id='aris'></a>aristocracy who had independence enough
to bid defiance to conventional proscription, and invite
whom she pleased to tea with her—whether it was the
President’s lady or her washer-woman. Mrs. Tower
to be sure had too much politeness to invite those whom
she knew her aristocratic neighbors did not choose to
recognize as equals when she invited <span class='it'>them</span>; but she
heartily despised the principle which governed her
wealthier acquaintances, in excluding the worthy poor
from their society <span class='it'>because</span> they were poor; and in the
face of all expostulation and astonishment, she disdained
such unreasonable trammels and acted accordingly,
though she well knew what surprise her decision
occasioned, and what gossip it furnished. But the
fault-finders—what could they do? They could not
proscribe Mrs. Tower, for she abounded in that one
great requisite for elevated station—a plenty of <span class='it'>money</span>—and
she could gather into her house more distinguished
people from the circle of her private acquaintance,
than half the village put together—they could not
lose the pleasure of such agreeable levees as Mrs.
Tower made for strangers who were visiting her at all
seasons of the year. Beside, just now when my story
commences, the young minister of the village was an
inmate of her family, and being unmarried and unbetrothed,
and there being at the same time a goodly
number of young ladies unmarried, but marriageable,
in the most important families of his parish, the minister,
Rev. Louis Style, became a very interesting character,
aside from his public capacity, and the unconscious
prize in quite an extensive lottery. But more of the
Rev. Louis Style anon.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One lovely evening in summer, a circle of young
ladies was sitting in the delicious moonlight that
streamed fitfully through the glancing leaves and fragrant
clusters of honeysuckle that shaded the veranda
of Mrs. Tower’s residence, chatting joyfully—the <span class='it'>girls</span>
I mean—not the honeysuckles or the moonlight, though
I could not vouch that <span class='it'>they</span> exchanged no love whispers
audible to the ears of fairies—laughing merrily
over the ices and fruit, and of course, gossiping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tower had been more than usually agreeable,
though she was always lovely; and as to Mr. Style,
he had carried every heart. The girls had all been
completely captivated; some by his calm and manly
beauty, and some by the flashing brilliancy of his ripe
and richly cultivated mind, and some by those inexpressible
fascinations, which, had he been a man of the
world, would have made him irresistible in all society.
But Mr. Style was a man of pure and exalted piety,
and would have conscientiously feared to use his
slightest power to interest a heart to which his own
must stoop from its own moral height to meet, or to
whose affection he could not earnestly respond. Indeed
so fastidious was the Rev. Mr. Style, that he had
never met the lady, as he determined, whom he could
cordially invite to the queenship of his affections. He
was verily so happy and contented as an inmate of
Mrs. Tower’s family in the pursuit of his daily duties—so
happy in the satisfaction and regard of his people,
that it seldom occurred to him that “it is not good for
a man to be alone.” The mammas and blooming
young ladies, however, adopted that doctrine as one of
the most important, prominent and practical of the
whole creed, and most especially did they set their
faces against so Popish a practice as the “celibacy of
the clergy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tower had withdrawn from the circle a few
minutes to examine the dispatches brought in by the
evening mail, but returning soon with a smile of unusual
gladness illuminating her pensive face, and an
open letter in her hand, she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, girls, I have intelligence here that makes me
very happy. I have at length prevailed with a young
friend of mine, to leave the city and pass a few weeks
with me during the hottest of the season, and I am so
very glad⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, so am I,” interrupted Miss Charlotte Varley, a
very languishing young lady, who had great hopes of
success with Mr. Style, since she had joined his communion
and was a teacher in his Sabbath-school—but
withal a <span class='it'>belle</span>—“a young gentleman from the city will
be very refreshing this terrible weather—I hope he is a
pious man, Mrs. Tower—we have so few of those—and
that he will bring us some new plans about Sabbath-schools
and benevolent societies such as are found
to be most useful in the city!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Varley closed her remarks with a small sigh,
and looked at Mr. Style for pious sympathy. Mr.
Style that moment turned away to pluck a drooping
blossom that hung near him, and some of the ruder
minxes indulged in mischievous glances and a smothered
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I declare, Charlotte,” interposed Miss Emilie
Jones, who was one of Miss Varley’s most sincere despisers,
“the effervescence of your regard for Sabbath-schools
and ‘cent societies,’ has quite anticipated the
sequel of Mrs. Tower’s story—you did not allow her
time to say whether we are to be favored by the accession
of a <span class='it'>lady</span> or a <span class='it'>gentleman</span> to our little country
community—but consulting your own fancy, I suppose
you took it for granted it must be a ‘pious young gentleman.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The color deepened in Charlotte’s really beautiful
face, as a glimpse of her ridiculous position flashed
from Emilie’s playful satire, and to increase her confusion,
the girls all laughed more saucily than before.
There might have been some serious heart-burnings,
but Mrs. Tower came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charlotte is entirely excusable, young ladies,” she
said, “and I am responsible for her remark by my own
ambiguity. My friend is a <span class='it'>lady</span>, and one of the loveliest
of her sex in mind and heart. I have not seen
her since she grew into a woman, but I am confident
from what I know of the development of her character,
I shall not be disappointed in the promise of her childhood.
She will be here in two weeks at most, and
possibly sooner. Now I am old and dull girls, and I
shall draw largely on your vivacity for her entertainment,
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
at <span class='it'>first</span> for <span class='it'>my</span> sake, and afterward, when you
know her, for her own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O yes, indeed, Mrs. Tower,” promised the girls,
and none more promptly than Charlotte and Adelaide
Varley, both for themselves and for their mother and
three sisters at home. They would specially make a
party for her, though they had determined to make <span class='it'>no</span>
parties till their friends, Mrs. Tyler and her daughter,
very genteel people from New York, should come,
which event could not certainly be hoped for at least
for three weeks. And Misses Charlotte and Adelaide
telegraphed to each other, while the rest were promising
their attentions, how much pleasure it must afford
Mrs. Tyler and Elizabeth if they should happen to recognize
a city acquaintance in Mrs. Tower’s expected
visiter—“as their metropolitan friends,” Charlotte remarked,
“were so very gay and fashionable, they had
sometimes languished in the country for a city face or
something that looked familiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a melancholy and most insupportable
deprivation,” chimed in Emilie Jones, “to spend a
whole fortnight on the stretch in such an ugly and unsightly
village as this of N. has the reputation of being,
especially in the summer, and all that time, not so
much as <span class='it'>see</span> fiery red brick palisades towering up on
both sides of you, and pouring down on your ‘devoted
head’ a perfect torrent of heat! I am sure if I were
anybody’s ‘metropolitan friends,’ I should mourn being
obliged to set my feet on the cool grass! How I
should miss the scorching them on a hot pavement, to
say nothing of the disadvantage to my lungs of inhaling
fresh clear air, instead of dust and cigar smoke, and
all sorts of vile fumes and abominations! What is
your taste, Mr. Style?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a great lover of the country, and particularly
of this beautiful village, Miss Emilie,” gallantly replied
Mr. Style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Emilie, enough of your mischief for
once,” said Adelaide Varley, with a very severe smile
which she meant for an indifferent one. “We all
know you are more wicked than citified. But my
watch says it is time to go home, and I guess Mrs.
Tower will be glad to be rid of such a set of chatter-boxes
as we have proved ourselves this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Style will write a livelier sermon for it, I’ll
wager my thimble, after he has slept upon the savor of
our conversation,” said Emilie, as she gave him her
hand at parting, and turned gayly round to bid Mrs.
Tower good night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come again, dears, every one of you,” said Mrs.
Tower, as she smiled on the youthful group, “come
every day and enliven us with the life of such glad
spirits. Mr. Style would lead a most monotonous life
indeed if <span class='it'>I</span> were all the company he could have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, indeed, my dearest Mrs. Tower,” replied
Emilie. “That man is verily avaricious who covets
better or more charming society than our most delightful
hostess of this evening, to say nothing of the ice
creams and etceteras! Yes, worthy of stripes is he,
whether clergyman or layman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Emilie finished her speech with a quick glance
at the young minister, and her own peculiarly rich and
musical shout of mirth, and tripped lightly down the
terrace and across the wide and shaded street to her
own home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the other young ladies of the party had farther to
go, Mr. Style took them all under his protection, rendering
particular assistance to Miss Charlotte, who
complained of excessive weariness and lassitude.
Beside, being occasionally afflicted with a difficulty of
the heart, she could not walk so fast as some of the
girls, so Mr. Style found himself safely at Mrs. Varley’s
door with his delicate charge, many minutes after
all the others were laughing and speculating about it
in their own rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Adelaide, what do you think of Mrs. Tower’s
coaxing a very pretty young lady to her house, to pass
some weeks in company with the Rev. Mr. Style?”
said Charlotte, very sharply, as she ran upstairs to
the parlor, in double quick time, quite independent of
the “heart difficulty,” that had so impeded her progress
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s downright scandalous!” said Miss Annette,
the eldest daughter, “and I should not wonder at any
breeze it might raise in the church and society—it
may result in something very unpleasant indeed!” and
Annette shook her head very doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is ridiculous! Nothing but a trap, depend on
it,” said Mrs. Varley, for Adelaide had detailed the
whole story with her own annotations long before
Charlotte reached home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is really a very presuming thing,” seriously responded
Annette, shaking her head still more dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes—very presumptuous indeed!” sneered
Mrs. Varley, who never had any opinions, only those
that were to be had at second hand. “Just as if Mrs.
Tower could not only dictate who we shall have for
minister, but also who he shall <span class='it'>marry</span>! for I declare,
girls, it looks like that—don’t it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure it does, mamma,” replied Annette;
“you have hit the nail on the head this time! It takes
<span class='it'>you</span> to see what folks are about behind the scenes.
Lottie, did you get any particulars about this person out
of Mr. Style, coming home—whether he ever saw
her—whether she is rich and fashionable, so it will do
for <span class='it'>us</span> to notice her⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Annette, I did not learn any thing about her,
though I asked questions enough in all conscience,”
fretted Charlotte. “But I think we had better write
immediately to Mrs. Tyler and find out something,”
she continued. “I declare, mamma,” and the tears
started to her eyes for very vexation and disappointment,
“Mr. Style would not speak only on the most
indifferent subjects coming home, and if I don’t bring
him to the point soon, I don’t believe one of us will
ever be married in the world, and I will go to a convent!
I <span class='it'>will</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say so, Lottie! don’t dear,” soothed the
mamma—“only think what good aim money takes at
the hearts of men, and are we not <span class='it'>rich</span>, child; and are
not my daughters fine dashing girls, dressing as well
as the best of ’em, and wont they finally marry <span class='it'>jest as
they please</span>? The chaff always blows away first, they
used to say when I was young!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who wants to wait forever, mother, for all
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
that?” said Annette, who really had waited a reasonable
time, with her purse and her heart in her hand,
and yet no bidders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> for one, want to wait till I am <span class='it'>sought</span>,” said
Adelaide, “and not make such a ridiculous matter of it
as Charlotte does, in her pursuit of Mr. Style. The
girls all laughed at your speeches, Lottie, till I am
heartily vexed and ashamed about the whole game.
Do be a little wiser in your demonstrations—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I’ll come and borrow some of the wisdom
<span class='it'>you</span> have to spare, Miss,” retorted Charlotte, very angrily,
as she rose and whisked out of the room, slamming
the door violently after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley and the three sisters, Annette, Almeda,
and Cynthia, all pounced upon Adelaide, who was
really more shrewd and sensible than they all, till she
diverted them from the attack by a narration of what
was always interesting, the gossip she had gathered
from one and another, together with her own active
surmises during the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had seen how Emilie Jones acted, mamma—I
could not help thinking Mr. Style and Mrs. Tower
were both delighted with her impudence,” said Adelaide.
“For my part, I think she is one of the
sauciest and most sarcastic imps I ever saw. If Capt.
Jones was not so rich and his family so influential, I
would cut her acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a mighty deal would she care for that,” replied
Annette, “so long as Mrs. Tower makes such
friends of her and her mother. But did she tell you
that her father and George are coming home directly?
Mrs. Jones was here to-night, and she said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—she did not say a word about it. She makes
no disclosures to me,” returned Adelaide. “There
will be another mark for our beautiful Charlotte—the
young lieutenant—if she does not succeed in her
‘ecclesiastical measures,’ ” she added, biting her lips
in expectation of a torrent of displeasure from her mother
and sisters. It came, of course, and in a fit of
resentment and passion, she too flirted off to bed.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Varley family were very wealthy <span class='it'>in purse</span>,
and <a id='itwas'></a>it was the only anchor with which they were
able to fasten themselves on society. They were ignorant,
vulgar, and haughty, proud, unprincipled, and
deceitful. A more designing, intriguing, manœuvring
woman than Mrs. Varley, can seldom be met with, but
her plans were all so superficially laid, and so very
shallow and short-sighted, they had so far unfortunately
failed, at least all the matrimonial alliances she had
projected for her five marriageable daughters—inasmuch
as they all remained a heavy article in a sated
market. Charlotte was the youngest, and in person,
so far as the delicate tinting of the face and a faultless
chiseling of form were concerned, she possessed unusual
loveliness. But the deformity of her ill disciplined
and misdirected mind, and the prominent
weakness of her character, were so apparent, that in
the estimate of really sensible and intelligent people,
the one favorable item passed for almost nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley had resolved to secure the Rev. Mr.
Style for her youngest daughter, and she determined
that nothing should be left undone to accomplish so desirable
an object. Charlotte was herself too weak to
play her part <span class='it'>well</span> in a well concerted scheme—but in
a miserably lame one, she played it wretchedly. Mr.
Style saw to his infinite but necessarily concealed disgust,
the snare that was spread in his sight, and though nothing
in the world was easier than to escape, it subjected
him to a mortifying espionage, and most disagreeable
caution in his pastoral intercourse with his people.
What the designs of others might be he was too high-minded
even to imagine; but there was no mistaking
Miss Charlotte Varley’s intentions, with eyes only half
open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Mr. Style had been an inmate of Mrs. Tower’s
household, Mrs. Varley had been making perpetual attempts
to place herself and her daughters on a footing
of intimacy there; but her efforts had been unsuccessful,
as Mrs. Tower was just as polite as ever, and just
as reserved as ever, leaving Mrs. Varley to guess at
the reason. Of course she put her own construction
upon the matter, and never failed, when she could find
or make an opportunity, to hint at something unfavorable
in relation to Mrs. Tower. She did, as malicious
people often do, foil herself with her own weapons,
for almost every body loved and admired Mrs. Tower,
and distrusted and disliked Mrs. Varley, though her
wealth and standing in society gave her a kind of influence
and power, which she and the five Misses
Varley most industriously exerted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tower’s clear mind fathomed at a glance the
intent of her neighbor, but the sentinels about the out-posts
of her prudence, were never for once caught
slumbering on duty, or taken in a moment of unguardedness;
and she sealed her discoveries in her own
breast, leaving her friend and protégé, the Rev. Mr.
Style, to his own conclusions and his own discretion.
He longed to ask her if his observations tallied with
hers, but he feared it might savor of conceit, or wear
some other unworthy aspect in her eyes, so they remained
mutually silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the condition of things when Mrs. Tower
welcomed to her house and her hospitalities the daughter
of her early friend, sweet Jessie Lincoln. An illness
of a few days had delayed her arrival, but the
paleness it had left on her cheek only added a charm
to her sad and lovely face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you are mine for a long, long time—for
<span class='it'>always</span>, Jessie,” said Mrs. Tower, as she folded the
gentle girl to her heart. “How long I have urged
you, and now you are really with me at length? How
like the Jessie of my childhood you are, dearest, and
how like the Jessie I laid beside her father in the
grave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The awakening of painful remembrances brought
the relief of mingled tears to the childless widow and
the orphan Jessie; but soon controlling her emotions
Mrs. Tower continued⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall preach one of my favorite doctrines in your
ears, my dear Jessie, till you are my proselyte indeed.
This notion of yours about dependence is <span class='it'>only</span> a notion.
It is banishing the bloom from your cheek, and
stealing from your whole youth the treasures of joyousness
which the young should especially garner.
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
There is bitterness enough laid up for meridian years,
Jessie, without casting so deep a shadow over the
light and the hope of your girlhood. You must henceforth
make my house your home, and be my own
daughter. Say, Jessie, will you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Jessie could only reply with her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least you must consider the matter,” proceeded
Mrs. Tower, “and if I succeed in making your stay
with me agreeable while you are my guest, I shall
certainly hope to persuade you. But dry those tears,
Jessie. I dare say I have opened the subject prematurely—if
you are not too weary for company to-night,
I must take you down stairs and introduce you to
some ladies I see coming up the avenue, to sympathize
in my gladness—Mrs. Jones and her Emilie. Mrs.
Jones is one of my dearest friends, and Emilie is a
wild, crazy-headed creature, but very sensible and
affectionate, and I am sure you will love her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie’s plain traveling-dress was exchanged for one
of simple white muslin, and the bright mass of her
beautiful black hair, released from its confinement,
fell in smooth, heavy ringlets over her shoulders. Her
whole air was a harmonious combination of ladylike
reserve and a native born gentility, which education
indeed may polish and improve, but can never implant.
Mrs. Tower fondly kissed the cheek of the graceful
girl, and then placing Jessie’s arm within her own,
she led her with almost maternal pride to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones and her daughter welcomed the young
stranger with the sincere cordiality of old friends, and
Emilie, who became immediately fascinated with the
simplicity and unassuming gentleness of her manner,
expressed the earnest hope that Miss Lincoln would
be happy enough to spend the whole summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have a country-loving taste, I am sure you
cannot find a lovelier spot than our own village, Miss
Lincoln—or Jessie—as I mean to call you when we
are no longer strangers,” said Emilie, her brilliant
face sparkling with kindness, as she sat down on the
sofa by Jessie’s side. “There is every thing beautiful
at Mrs. Tower’s I know,” she continued, “but I am
so wild, and so much of a rambler that I love the
forests and glens and waterfalls, and above all horseback
excursions! We have a pair of fine saddle-horses
that papa has just brought home—high-spirited
creatures they are—they make me think of Zenobia’s
horses. Don’t you ride on horseback, Miss Jessie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie had never practiced at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O well! I can learn you in a very little time, and
I’ll undertake to be your tutor in horsemanship, for I
am far more notable in it, than in some <span class='it'>more</span> feminine
accomplishments. Do you hear <a id='mymy'></a>my boast Mrs.
Tower? I have engaged to learn Miss Lincoln to ride
on horseback, in which art I have informed her <span class='it'>I excel</span>!”
and Emilie laughed heartily at her own nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No very unreasonable boast, Miss Emilie,” said
Mr. Style; “and I think Miss Lincoln would have
no difficulty in believing every word, if she had seen
you practicing your Arabs this morning. I was confident
your neck would be broken! But have you
found names for the horses yet? You were in a grave
study about that last evening!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O yes, Mr. Style, I am happily relieved of that
anxiety. I could not think of christening them with
those Quixotic names which you suggested, for I
knew I could never remember them—and I was so
troubled to suit myself, that I referred the whole matter
to papa and George, and after a protracted and
laborious discussion, they declared for the illustrious
names of Romulus and Remus! I hope they may not
quarrel for precedence, as those old worthies did!
Indeed I shall be wrathful enough if Romulus practices
any imposition or violence on Remus, for he is
decidedly my favorite, and not entirely a <span class='it'>non resistant</span>
I discover. But I shall give Miss Lincoln her introductory
lessons on my docile old Betty, who has
run so many delightful races for my pleasure. After
that I purpose to settle a pension on Betty, and leave
her to enjoy a calm old age. O I long to be about it!
Will you be too tired to take your first ride to-morrow
morning, Miss Lincoln? Betty is quiet as a kitten,
and will kneel to take you on her back. Mrs. Tower’s
avenue behind the garden is just the place too. Mrs.
Tower may we ride there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly you may, Emilie,” replied Mrs Tower.
“I give you the range of my house and grounds, together
with the command of my carriage and coachman,
till you shall get Jessie acclimated!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is noble, Mrs. Tower! All I want. Your
avenue is longer and wider than ours. I am sure I
shall have roses as red as my own on Jessie’s cheek
in a very little while. And you, Mr. Style, may prepare
yourself for a challenge to a horse-race, when
Miss Lincoln can ride my Romulus!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie expressed unbounded delight at the prospect
of amusement that was before her, and offered a thousand
thanks to Emilie for her willingness to instruct
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O pray don’t say a word about that,” replied
Emilie. “Perhaps I shall not prove so competent as
I promise. But if I fail, Mr. Style here shall finish
your education!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Style,” said Mrs. Tower, when the
ladies had made their adieux, “you must take charge
of Jessie’s entertainment, while I attend to a little
business. I am sure she will be pleased with the conservatory?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young clergyman very readily undertook the
commission, and throwing open a door from the
drawing-room, he led the delighted girl into a sweet
wilderness of flowers and fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks glided by almost imperceptibly, for
Jessie Lincoln had never experienced such a full
tide of happiness. The cool, fresh country zephyr
kissed her cheeks, and there crept over them a delicious
tinting, delicate as the blush of a rose-bud.
Vigorous exercise, rural walks, and every kind of
simple pleasure banished the sickly and languid expression
from her face, and with returning health came
vigor, vivacity, and joyousness. George and Emilie
Jones were unwearied in their devotion to Jessie’s
happiness; the Varleys had outdone everybody in
promises of attention and politeness, especially Miss
Charlotte, who found very frequent occasion to watch
for any indications of Mr. Style’s preference of Jessie
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
before herself. Poor Charlotte! she longed to read his
heart; the indifference, nay, positive aversion she
would have discovered there, would have been “the
gall of bitterness” to her own, for she was deeply and
desperately in love, if ever a silly young woman was,
and a breath could have fanned her electrical jealousy
into an uncontrollable flame. She would have given
the last farthing of her fortune for an assurance of
affection from the young minister. Alas! he never
gave her any; yet at this juncture, without the slightest
reason to believe he regarded her with any other sentiment
than the commonest acquaintance, she confidently
did believe she had taken him in her toils, and
he would soon declare himself her admirer, unless Jessie
stood in the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was impossible not to see with one’s eyes open
that Mr. Style was becoming deeply and vitally interested
in Jessie, though in her simplicity and humility
she was wholly unconscious of it; and if she had conceived
the possibility of such a thing, she would bitterly
have rebuked her own presumption, for she regarded
herself altogether too humble to aspire to such
a position in the world as to become the wife of such
a gifted man. It is true that the lustre of his mind, the
high tone of his moral endowments, and the faultlessness
of his exterior moulding, <span class='it'>charmed</span> her—and what
young heart would they <span class='it'>not</span> charm, I pray you tell me,
dear lady reader? But the idea of loving Mr. Style
with any other love than that which is inspired and
sanctioned by respect and friendship merely never
entered her mind. Jessie was, however, the beau
ideal of all his visions—the pure, pious, refined, and
high-souled woman he had always hoped to meet
before he surrendered his heart with its rich treasury
of manly and generous love. He knew her history—you
shall know more of it anon, reader—and he admired
and revered the strength and unconquerable resolution
with which she had combated and triumphed
in the midst of the most depressing discouragements.
Respect, admiration, love, combined to make him—no,
not a willing slave at her feet—he felt her moral
nobility would revolt at that; but they made him ready
to plant his strength by the side of her weakness, to be
its defence and protection till the death-angel should
come, commissioned to guide her from earth to heaven.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tyler and Elizabeth, Mrs. Varley’s genteel
“metropolitan friends,” had detained themselves at
Saratoga so long as the most fashionable company remained.
But they at length wrote a hasty note to the
“dear Varleys” stating definitely when they should be
at the depôt in N., expecting to see the carriage in
waiting. And they did come, “bag and baggage,” to
stay till November—it was only <span class='it'>August</span> then, and
they flattered themselves, so they announced, that even
in so short a stay, very much happiness might be reciprocated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prime advantage of Mrs. Tyler’s acquaintance
to the Varley family, consisted in the circumstance
that that lady and her daughter boarded at what they
called one of the most fashionable houses in the city.
Mrs. Tyler despised housekeeping; it confined one so
to the mercy of servants, besides <span class='it'>company</span> made it so
troublesome and expensive. The Miss Varleys could
go and board at the same place in the winter, and Mrs.
Tyler would be so very kind and condescending as to
“take all the trouble of <span class='it'>chaperoning</span> them into the
society of the ‘upper ten thousand,’ and nobody could
with any certainty predict what advantages might
accrue; perhaps a splendid settlement, perhaps”—I
know not how many inducements she possessed, all
of which sounded golden enough in the ears of the
Miss Varleys when they made her acquaintance at
—— Beach the season before, and insured for her what
she intended, an invitation to the country when it was
genteel to go into the country without such a bill of
expense. The sphere in which Mrs. Tyler actually
moved was only in the same pseudo-genteel orbit with
the Mrs. Washington Potts’s, Mrs. De Perouk’s and a
similar galaxy of inferior magnitude, to whose acquaintance
and real claims to respect our shrewd and
gifted countrywoman, has introduced so many delighted
and instructed readers. Blessings on her simplicity,
and on her two-edged satire; blessings on her
mind and her pen, for holding up a mirror before the
face of society, in which it may see not only its lineaments
of loveliness, but also its deformities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tyler was a very small, <span class='it'>dried-up</span> woman, if I
may be tolerated for the expression, though a row of
beautiful porcelain teeth displayed themselves whenever
she parted her parched and skinny lips; her cheeks
were most unnaturally rosy—I should have said
<span class='it'>rougey</span>! A profusion of smooth and glossy ringlets
adorned her head, and her whole dress was so in the
extreme of fashion, there could have been, indeed, but
a paltry difference between her “polar and equatorial
diameter.” Brilliants sparkled in her gay caps, among
the <a id='rib'></a>ribbons and roses; gems flashed on her withered
hands; “tinkling ornaments, cauls, round tires like the
moon, chains, and bracelets, and mufflers, bonnets and
head-bands, and tablets, earrings and rings, changeable
suits of apparel, mantles, and wimples, and crisping-pins,
glasses, fine linen, hoods and veils,” figuratively
speaking, the Prophet’s whole catalogue of a Judean
toilette, was in requisition, with many modern inventions,
at which a Judean maiden would have stood
aghast, to make a vain old woman young again! O,
miserable ambition!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Elizabeth was large and masculine in all her
proportions, with an ungraceful stoop in her shoulders,
coarse and prominent features, staring blue eyes, a
brilliant and exquisite complexion, and most unusually
beautiful hair. Her manners were intended to be easy
and nonchalant, while in truth, to the eyes of true refinement,
they were unpardonably bold and rude.
Miss Tyler had persuaded herself she was a <span class='it'>wit</span>, her
sayings had sometimes occasioned so much laughter,
and she delighted to use her fancied power everywhere,
and on all occasions, shooting the shafts of her
sarcasm and irony hither and thither without delicacy,
civility, or mercy. She dressed gaudily and expensively,
while her father drudged behind the counter
of his “hardware and leather establishment,” early and
late to support such enormous and unnecessary expenditures.
She read novels “all night,” and was
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
familiar with the fate of every hero and heroine, from
those of Bulwer, Eugene Sue, and George Sand, down
to the prettiest specimen of “yellow-covered literature”
for sale in small retail beer-shops, or peddled in railroad
cars by newsboys. She gloried in the unfeminine
and unprincipled habit of laughing at and ridiculing
people in their very presence, if their backs were
turned, and especially <span class='it'>country people</span>; was strangely
familiar with strangers; laughed and talked very loud
in the streets, shops, and public conveyances, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.
Dear reader, I need not fill my outline more definitely;
with a blush for the honor of my sex, I am compelled
to admit there is more than <span class='it'>one</span> Elizabeth Tyler in
“these degenerate days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the next day after Mrs. Tyler and her daughter
arrived Mrs. Varley gave a very extensive invitation
to the <span class='it'>ton</span> of the village, to assemble at her house in
the evening, to pay their respects and make the acquaintance
of her most distinguished visiters. The
invitation, of course, included Mr. Style, Mrs. Tower,
and Jessie Lincoln, concerning whom they had unaccountably
neglected to make any inquiries, strange
as it may seem, when she was the object of such
nervous anxiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From eight till nine, poor Charlotte sat on the sofa
by the side of Miss Tyler, terribly dispirited, and
eagerly watching for the announcement of the Rev.
Mr. Style. Elizabeth rallied her in vain; she scarcely
remembered to introduce her friend, and tried fruitlessly
to be amused by Elizabeth’s coarse and unladylike
satires on the really elegant company as they entered.
By and by Charlotte and Elizabeth simultaneously
started; Charlotte rose from her seat, and Miss Tyler
suddenly seized her arm, as if to detain her till some
surprise was explained, and leveled her quizzing-glass
deliberately at a group who were that moment exchanging
salutations with Mrs. Varley near the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is Mr. Style! that’s him! that splendid
figure!” whispered Charlotte, who had neither eyes
nor ears for any one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious, Charlotte Varley! what kind of company
do you entertain, for mercy’s sake!” very audibly
ejaculated Miss Tyler. “Upon my word, if there
isn’t my <span class='it'>mantuamaker</span>, Jessie Lincoln, invited to a
party to honor <span class='it'>us</span>, mamma! Isn’t that a pretty piece
of impudence! Well, I did think you were genteel
people, and decently aristocratic before—you Varleys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laud!” chimed the mamma, displaying her elegant
row of porcelain, and fanning herself vigorously,
“Who is the people that’s distinguished by such
elustrious visiters as <span class='it'>sewing-women</span>, and takes ’em
out into company? Don’t introduce <span class='it'>us</span>, Miss Varley!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Havn’t you got some tailoress girls, and school
ma’ams stowed away somewhere, Lottie, that you are
going to bring out, to give distinction to this <span class='it'>mélange</span>?”
sneered Elizabeth, in a lower tone, with a most contemptuous
smile, before Charlotte had time to recover
from her confusion enough to apologize that the company
was no more exclusively patrician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is Mrs. Tower’s visiter,” stammered Charlotte,
in a whisper, as Mrs. Tyler and Elizabeth rose from
the sofa, and majestically walked a little aside, lest the
despised mantuamaker should approach near enough
to make an introduction inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>towering</span> specimen she must be!” punned
Elizabeth to Miss Emilie Jones, who had stood near
the sofa, leaning on the arm of her brother. The blood
mounted to Emilie’s forehead, in an angry flood, and
the bitterest retort rushed with the speed of lightning
to her lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, Emilie,” softly whispered her more prudent
brother, as he saw the resentment of the insult to
her friends, flashing in luminous sparkles from her
black and brilliant eyes. “Silence is the ‘better part
of valor’ just now, sister!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emilie darted from his side, and in a few minutes
she had clustered a charming circle of ladies and gentlemen
about Miss Lincoln, and by the most graceful
and assiduous attentions, she sought to banish the cruel
embarrassment and mortification Miss Tyler’s vulgar
rudeness had occasioned, for Jessie had instantly recognized
her, and guessed at the import of her contemptuous
remarks, by the inquiring eyes that were
immediately bent upon her, from the vicinity in which
Miss Tyler had made her communications. She did
not blush for the truth that she was poor, and had heretofore
gained her livelihood by the labor of her hands,
but the curious and somewhat disdainful glances which
she felt were directed toward her, chafed her sensitiveness
to its tenderest vitality. She did, indeed,
shrink from the charge of intrusion and presumption,
which she had no doubt many hearts were preferring
against her, however politeness might for the moment
peek to conceal it. Poor Jessie tried to appear composed
as if nothing had happened to pain her, but she
found her self-possession deserting her in her utmost
need. The hand that rested on Emilie’s arm trembled—the
great tears struggled into Jessie’s eyes—her
cheeks glowed one moment with the heat of a fever,
and the next her face was almost as colorless as the
white dress she wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do take me to some less conspicuous place,
Emilie,” she whispered, “this cruel scrutiny kills me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emilie did as she was requested, and apparently
without design, extricated her from the group around
her, led her to a seat by an open window, and sat
down by her, with so much sympathy and distress in
her usually joyous face, that poor Jessie was quite
overcome, and was obliged to screen herself with the
curtain to conceal her irrepressible tears. As she took
hold of the folds of the curtain, the massive drapery
fell, and so rich and dark was the velvet, that it entirely
concealed those within from those without, who were
gayly promenading the piazza, or lingering listlessly
in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some movement diverted almost all the company
from the room, and also from the piazza near the
window where Jessie and Emilie were sitting, and the
same movement gave Mr. Style an unobserved opportunity
to join them. Emilie looked in his face—there
was a sternness and resentment in its expression
that puzzled her for a moment, it was so unlike him,
but his first remark solved her difficulty at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so distressed, Miss Lincoln—it is not
difficult to put the right interpretation—” and then he
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
bit his lips to stay the wrathful thoughts that were
clamoring for utterance. A gleam of delight illuminated
Emilie’s eyes, and she involuntarily extended
her hand to him, in token of her sympathy with all he
had refrained from uttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” she said, and the bitterest scorn was in her
glance and tone, “you are a prudent man, I know, but
I am a fearless and reckless being, and I shall take the
liberty to read out the interpretation, you no doubt
wisely repress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, dear Emilie,” expostulated Jessie, “I
will beg Mrs. Tower to release me from my promise,
and I will go where I shall not involve my generous
friends in such painful and humiliating circumstances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! Jessie Lincoln, never!” warmly remonstrated
Emilie, “you shall⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was interrupted by the sound of footfalls and
smothered voices on the piazza without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not be an impertinent <a id='list'></a>listener,” she said, “but
I recognize Charlotte’s voice. Something of interest to
you, Mr. Style, I presume, for I hear your name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The footsteps drew nearer, and the voices grew
more clear and audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we are alone, Elizabeth,” said Charlotte, “I
must tell you my troubles. I had every reason to believe
Mr. Style was in love with me—mamma says I
had—and I have no doubt he was on the eve of a declaration,
which would have made me the proudest
and happiest creature in the world, when Mrs. Tower
brought about the advent of that minx of a low-bred
Jessie Lincoln, whose true place in the world you
have been good enough to disclose. How I do despise
her! I know Mrs. Tower got her here on purpose
to <span class='it'>foil</span> me. They say she manages admirably to
keep them together, and that Mistress Jessie is ready
to dog him everywhere, and throw herself eternally in
his way. And then that saucy Emilie Jones, my
worst enemy, sustains her in it all, and helps it forward.
I don’t know what ridiculous things that bewitched
mantuamaker wont do to raise herself into genteel
society, and save any more mantuamaking. But I declare,
Elizabeth, I shall <span class='it'>die</span> without him! What shall
I do? How shall I manage it? Come, you know?”
Charlotte’s voice began to tremble as if she were in
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crimson blush—but it was the blush of indignant
innocence—burnt Jessie’s face, neck and arms. She
rose to go, but Mr. Style, with contempt and disgust,
and utter indignation battling with discretion for the
mastery in every lineament of his face, gently drew
her to a seat again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do?” responded the heartless and unprincipled
Elizabeth, “why, let me think. He does somehow
seem to be a prize worth capturing, he is so stately and
handsome. I am not sure, Lottie, but I shall come
into the ranks to contend for him myself, ha! ha! ha!
At least you could afford me the pleasure of a flirtation,
just while I stay! I would not snap my finger,
however, for a little obscure country parson for a <span class='it'>husband</span>!
Well, I guess you must manage to get some
story into currency, that will give her an impulse back
to her patterns and fashion-plates, and make him a
chance to forget such a very meek and meaching face,
and sanctimonious demeanor; but mind you, don’t
mention your <span class='it'>authority</span>. I shall be terribly angry if
you do, for these sewing-girls get possession of a great
many things they might circulate to one’s disadvantage
you know—and they are so touchy and jealous, they
are really a very mischievous class of persons. But
let me tell you a fact. I lost a splendid bracelet that
cost me forty dollars at one dress-maker’s! I will not
mention her name, but you can make <span class='it'>your own inferences</span>!”
And Elizabeth Tyler and Charlotte Varley
maliciously giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may draw <span class='it'>mine</span> too, may I not?” said Emilie
Jones, as she sprang to her feet, with dashing eyes and
indignation burning in every feature. Thrusting aside
the drapery, she presented herself on the piazza, with
an air as imperial as a second Zenobia defending the
honor of her Palmyra. But the offending parties had
hastily retreated, and mingled with the other guests
who were returning from a stroll in the beautiful garden,
which was gayly enough illuminated to be the trysting-place
of Houries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be calm, Jessie—Miss Lincoln,” said Mr. Style,
as he drew her unresisting arm within his own.
“Such malice always works ruin to those who
cherish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie’s wounded heart fluttered strangely. The
cruel and unprovoked injustice she suffered, awoke
her pride, and made her stronger in body and spirit,
while the mingling of the champion and the lover in Mr.
Style’s tone and manner reassured her, and restored
her self-possession. He placed her by the side of
Mrs. Tower, who was chatting agreeably, wholly
ignorant that any thing had occurred to disturb or distress
Jessie, then attached himself to one and another
circle, as he saw their entertainment flagging, and at
length he found himself by the side of Miss Charlotte
and her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mr. Style,” said Charlotte, as she laid her
small, fair hand on his arm, and looked up languidly
in his face; “you have been so choice of yourself
or so democratic to-night, I have hardly seen you
at all. Now it is your duty as a knight-errant, to make
yourself agreeable to my dearest friend, Miss Tyler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Style was disgusted almost to loathing, and in
his soul he shrunk from the false and deceitful woman,
whose deliberate wickedness and folly his own senses
had so unwillingly attested. But he gallantly bowed
in obedience to Charlotte’s familiar challenge, and
addressed something very common-place to Miss
Tyler. She was transformed in a moment, and became
all vivacity, and wit, and life. She joked and
frolicked, and laughed till the attention of the company
was attracted, and poor Charlotte began to be most
cruelly jealous. Indeed, so entirely did Miss Tyler
attach herself to Mr. Style, that emancipation was
hopeless for the remainder of the evening. At a late
hour the guests departed; and painful, indeed, were
the disclosures Jessie made to Mrs. Tower, of the
misery and mortification she had endured so innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do let me go to-morrow, dear Mrs. Tower, my
mother; I can never endure that the humbleness of
my station should expose you to reproach like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jessie,” replied Mrs. Tower, as she drew
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
the weeping girl to her bosom. “You are my
own daughter now, and by an instrument legally
attested, no longer dependent on your own exertions,
but my chosen and acknowledged heiress. It is no
reproach to you, my dearest child, among those whose
true elevation of mind and character places them above
the necessity of those artificial props, which are
always called to sustain assumption—that you were
reared under the clouds of misfortune, or that your
own hands supported an invalid father and mother.
Jessie, I honor you for it, and the gift of a fortune is
but a trifling reward. Say no more about leaving me—you
cannot and you must not do it. Leave this
matter all to my ‘elder wisdom,’ and forget it in the
repose your mind and body need.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The following morning, as Mrs. Tower and Jessie
were sitting in the library, with Emilie Jones and her
brother, a servant brought in an awkwardly folded and
hastily written note, and presenting it to Jessie, informed
her that the bearer waited in the hall for a
reply. Jessie opened the unsealed paper and read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lincoln,—The buttons on my traveling dress,
which you made, do not give me any satisfaction.
This is for you to come to Mrs. Varley’s this afternoon,
directly after dinner, and alter them, and I shall
expect you to make no extra charge for it.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Elizabeth Tyler.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“P. S. Mrs. Varley’s family would be willing to
employ you on my recommendation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The color went and came in Jessie’s cheek, as she
read the deliberate insult the writer evidently intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Jessie?” said Emilie, whose electrical
sympathy was instantly roused, “any thing more from
those abominable Tylers? Pray let me see?” Mrs.
Tower looked over Emilie’s shoulder as she read.
“What insolence! Jessie Lincoln, if I were only a
<span class='it'>man</span>, I am sure I should avenge your insult in single
combat! Why, brother, are <span class='it'>you</span> a man, and will you
see a lady treated like that?” she continued with
thrilling emphasis, throwing the note disdainfully out
of her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sister, I hope I am a man,” replied the young
naval officer, “but not quite so hot-headed and reckless
a man as <span class='it'>you</span> would have made. If you were on
board our vessel, I fear we might have our hands full
to keep you out of ‘affairs of honor!’ Miss Lincoln, I
presume,” he continued, laying down the note, while
a flush slowly crept to his forehead, “has wisdom
enough to manage with the contempt it deserves, so
very contemptible an assault!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will reply to it, Jessie,” said Mrs. Tower, as she
sat down before her writing-table and wrote:⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Tower takes the liberty to decline for Miss
Lincoln, the proposition Miss Tyler has seen fit to
make, as the change in Miss Lincoln’s circumstances
and prospects renders any further intercourse with
Miss Tyler unbefitting entirely. That intercourse is
therefore at an end.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie begged that any thing so like retaliation,
might not be sent, as Miss Tyler was unquestionably
instigated by the Varleys, who were too cowardly
to assail her only through a tool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It becomes me, Jessie, to vindicate the honor of
my family, and I feel justified in checking such
effrontery, and foiling it with its own weapons,” insisted
Mrs. Tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes indeed!” said Emilie. “I’m glad of it,
Mrs. Tower, and I only wish <span class='it'>I</span> had the inditing of the
reply. It would scorch like a flame, I’m sure it
would, every word of it. Do, please charge me with
the delivery of the missive, Mrs. Tower! my fingers
ache for the commission, and I’ll add an oral appendix
on my <span class='it'>own</span> hook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, no, Emilie,” replied Mrs. Tower, smiling; “I
appreciate your generous intention, but I fear your
enthusiasm and indignation might spoil your embassy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the whole Varley family were indulging
in boisterous exultation over Elizabeth’s “capital
trick, to show a mantuamaker girl that she was out
of her reckoning when she sailed into <span class='it'>their</span> latitude—she
did not belong with <span class='it'>them</span>, no how you could fix
it;” for it must be humiliating, indeed, to be ordered
to such paltry service after deceiving such wealthy
and important people into showing her some distinguished
civilities. Charlotte said she “guessed it
would convince Mr. Style that there was something
to choose between an heiress and a servant!” Mrs.
Tyler simpered from behind her porcelain, that “it
would learn people to know their places—and one
<span class='it'>might</span> lose some <span class='it'>custom</span> by such a fraud on society—the
matter would not stop in a corner!” Annette declared
it was “too good.” Mrs. Varley echoed, as
usual, the respective opinions, as they came from the
mint, and Adelaide gleefully suggested that it “might
taste a little bitter to Mrs. Tower’s palate, as she made
such a prodigious favorite of the girl. For <span class='it'>her</span> part,
she expected Mrs. Tower would import a colony of
chimney-sweeps, to give brilliancy to society there,
she was so much the patron of the ‘lower classes!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the reply came far sooner than it was looked
for, and exultation speedily changed hands with consternation.
What could it mean? “Change in her
circumstances and prospects!” What possible interpretation
could be applied to that? Charlotte fell into
hysterics, and screamed she “knew it could mean
nothing less than that Jessie Lincoln was engaged to
Mr. Style!” and to complete the excitement, she actually
fainted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious me!” stormed Miss Tyler, almost
choking with passion, “I should like to know what
‘change of circumstances and prospects,’ can license
an impertinent, presuming, poverty-pinched
hussy of a dress-maker to withdraw her acquaintance
from a lady of <span class='it'>my</span> position in the fashionable world!
Mother, did we tear ourselves from the importunities
of our city friends, and patronize these Varleys, for
such insulting treatment as this? Mrs. Varley, we did
not know you lived among Hottentots, or we should
have refused to come here, in the face of all your
urgency, every soul of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley and her four conscious daughters, vituperated,
apologized, and appeased, as well as their
own choler would permit, the excited and wrathful
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
visiters, who declared “they would leave the house
and the town immediately, and spread the story as
far as the newspapers would carry it, and that was
everywhere!” But it was finally suggested by the
daring Adelaide, that her mother should go to Mrs.
Tower, clothed with all the terror of their united resentment,
and demand a satisfactory explanation.
Especially was she commissioned to discover if possible
what sudden “change in circumstances and
prospects,” had set Jessie Lincoln upon such a pinnacle
over the heads of everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I declare, girls,” said Mrs. Varley to her daughters,
in secret session, before she started on her errand, “I
do feel like pizon about this affair! I am half skart out
of my wits at such a breeze between us and Mrs.
Tower! I wish to the mercy we had never seen these
mischief-making Tylers! As if them that touches porcupines
mustn’t expect the quills! Or them that insults,
to be insulted back again. I don’t believe they
are half so <span class='it'>rich</span> and <span class='it'>uppercrust</span> as they pretend—and
then they make such a sight of trouble! Besides, you
know what I told you I surmised about Mrs. Tower.
If it <span class='it'>is</span> so, she will be sure to let me and other people
know it, if she hasn’t already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls all looked doubtfully at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish in my heart these Tylers would go,” said
Annette, “for of all the conceited trumpery old sights
that ever I saw, Mrs. Tyler is the foremost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot express my detestation of Liz,” interrupted
Adelaide. “She is as false and cunning as the
very old snake himself, and bad as <span class='it'>I</span> am, I do think
<span class='it'>she</span> is worse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charlotte had come to life enough by this time to
mention Miss Tyler’s flirtation with Mr. Style, when
she was checked by Adelaide with,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! she is coming—it’s said <span class='it'>somebody</span> is always
at hand when you are talking about him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, do go quick, Mrs. Varley! Havn’t you got
ready <span class='it'>yet</span>? I’m terribly impatient for that woman’s
apology;” said Miss Tyler, as she unceremoniously
opened the door and thrust in her face. “But what
are you talking about with closed doors? <span class='it'>Us</span>, I presume!
You look caught, every one of you,” and Miss
Tyler turned up her disdainful nose, as if there would
be no further amity till she heard a disclaimer of that
offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, no, no, Lizzie, my dear!” supplicated Mrs.
Varley, in her blandest and most conciliatory tone.
“Pray come right in, love, and cheer up these poor disconsolate
<a id='creat'></a>creatures while I am gone. Bring my hat
and parasol, Adelaide. Shameful, isn’t it, to drag a
body out in this briling sunshine, on such business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were saying,” remarked Adelaide, as she
handed the bonnet and parasol to her mother, “how
much we do despise these deceitful kind of upstarts,
who pretend to be so much more than they
really are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the tendency of our American institootions,”
replied Elizabeth, in a tone more pacific, but very
affectedly sage, as she settled herself indolently into a
rocking-chair. “They encourage upstarts! You don’t
see nothing of this kind in England. For my part, I
think it devolves on the higher classes to—to—hem—”
she found herself unexpectedly wading beyond her
depth, and unfortunately afloat in the high flown piece
of wisdom she had started to express. Charlotte
hastened to the rescue, in a very luminous climax to
Miss Tyler’s halting proposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To let them know,” she interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to let them know!” replied Elizabeth, with
clinching emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mrs. Varley was sailing majestically
along the street toward Mrs. Tower’s residence. Her
face was very brazen, but there was a trembling and
apprehension in her heart, which communicated itself
to her body, and her hand shook nervously as she
twitched the door-bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mrs. Tower in?” she said to the servant who
opened the door, in a very sharp and insolent voice—and
before he had time to reply, she added, “go and
tell her that Mrs. Varley wishes to speak with her
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes Mrs. Tower entered the drawing-room,
her countenance and carriage as placid as if
never a breath had disturbed her. A cold and haughty
bow was the response she received to her polite and
polished greeting. Mrs. Varley seemed entirely at a
loss for her next measure—she was confused—exceedingly
confused, but the sternness of her coarse
features softened not a shadow. Mrs. Tower inquired
for the health of her family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am! it becomes you to ask, I should think,”
retorted Mrs. Varley, very bitterly. “Did you write
this note, ma’am?” and she advanced toward Mrs.
Tower with the offending document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, indeed, Mrs. Varley,” replied Mrs. Tower,
as she just glanced at the note, and gave it back to
Mrs. Varley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you did! and you seem very cool and indifferent
about it, too, as if it was a small matter to insult a
genteel family like mine, just because we wont have
any thing to do with the lower clashes, nor uphold <span class='it'>you</span>
in it,” said Mrs. Varley, losing all control of herself,
and swelling her tones as she grew angrier and angrier,
to the keen and wiry pitch peculiar to the voice
of an excited woman. “I’ll thank you to tell me
what it means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely what it says,” replied Mrs. Tower, in a
low, calm voice; “but what do <span class='it'>you</span> mean by the
‘lower classes?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean all <span class='it'>mantymakers</span>, and servants, and
tradespeople, and everybody that <span class='it'>works</span> for a livin’,”
quickly responded Mrs. Varley—she was fortified on
that point. “I’d have you to know that my family is
too rich and high up in the world to have any thing at all
to do with them sort of folks, whatever <span class='it'>yours</span> may be,
Mrs. Tower! But I know one’s bringing up has a
great deal to do with one’s genteelety—it don’t set
easy on everybody!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very pertinent remark, Mrs. Varley,” replied
Mrs. Tower, with an effort to repress a smile. “I
conclude you do not embrace your visiters in your
catalogue of the ‘lower classes?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed! that’s what I don’t! they are very
wealthy, and fashionable, and high-bred people, and
know all the richest and fashionablest people in the
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
city of New York; and what’s more, they know how
to resent an affront as well as some other folks—I guess
you will find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must take the liberty to correct one of your
statements, madam,” replied Mrs. Tower. “Mr.
Tyler, the husband and father of your visiters, rents
his hardware store in New York of the business agent
of my adopted daughter and heiress, Miss Jessie Lincoln,
to whom I have given my estates in that city.
And, moreover, he is so deeply indebted for borrowed
capital, to support the extravagance of his wife and
daughter, that every farthing he possesses would not
liquidate his debt. So much for the wealth and independence
of the <span class='it'>tradesman’s</span> family. As to the
fashionable part of the story, without any arrogance I
may assert that my acquaintance for years has included
the first and wealthiest families in New York,
and I venture to affirm that in those circles Mrs. Tyler
and her designing daughter were never so much as
heard of!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley began to look crestfallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she rejoined, “I don’t know but it <span class='it'>may</span> be
so, but I have no reason to think it is. At any rate,
they don’t hug up mantymakers, and take ’em out
visiting with them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Varley,” replied Mrs. Tower, rising from
her chair and assuming a moral majesty before which
her narrow-souled assailant quailed, “I acknowledge
it is exasperation which prompts to the disclosure of
another truth, which may sound rather painfully to
your pride. I deplore the occasion, but you have
really driven me to it, in order to vindicate the dignity
of my family, which you have willfully wounded.
Mrs. Varley, <span class='it'>you</span> were a servant in my father’s house—you
contracted a vicious and disgraceful marriage
with a servant in a large gambling establishment in the
city of Baltimore, where we then resided, and when
you ran away with your husband—my <span class='it'>casket</span> of <span class='it'>jewels</span>
went with you! I <span class='it'>saw</span> you take it, but I forebore to
expose you to my father, because I pitied your sin
and folly, and I knew the severity of his sense of justice
and injury would pursue you without mercy, so
he died in ignorance of your crime. You lived in
degradation and poverty for years and years, and I
have seen those fastidious daughters of yours, now so
sensitive lest they should be contaminated by contact
with what you are pleased to call the “lower classes,”
ragged and hungry in the streets of C., while I lived
in that city with my departed husband. And more than
once have I carried food and clothing to the miserable
abode you called your home. Do you remember your
own almost mortal illness when the cholera scourged
that city? Some fortunate stakes at the gaming-table
subsequently put Mr. Varley in possession of considerable
sums of money, and the diligent pursuit of the
same vicious business for many successful years, has
put you and your family in possession of an independent
fortune. For these facts I can refer you to authorities
if you will. Now, have I read this chapter of
your private history correctly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley turned every imaginable color as the
relation proceeded—pale, red, speckled and spotted.
She was utterly confounded for a moment, and then
she exclaimed, as she seized Mrs. Tower’s passive
hand in both her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josepha Gordon! I have sometimes thought it
must be the same!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josepha Gordon was my maiden name,” replied
Mrs. Tower, calmly yet sorrowfully watching the
whirlwind in poor Mrs. Varley’s soul. “Twenty
years, and bitter sorrows, have wrought more changes
in me than fortune has in <span class='it'>you</span>, Cynthia Varley. But
have I spoken truly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley could scarcely reply; she sunk down
upon the sofa completely overcome. Mortification
and deep humiliation seemed to paralyze her faculties.
Tears, and sobs, and groans, right pitiful to witness
followed. One moment a storm of furious passion
rose in her bosom, and the next a torrent of tears
poured over her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all true,” she stammered at length; “but O
don’t, for mercy’s sake, don’t expose us! It would
be our ruin, our utter ruin, and I am sure I have suffered
enough already. I will restore your jewels
fourfold,” and she began nervously working at a magnificent
diamond that sparkled on her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep the jewels, Mrs. Varley. I do not need
them, neither will I accept what you have so long
called your own,” said Mrs. Tower mildly. “I know
not what remorseful visitings have struggled in your
heart, but if they had wrought a moral renovation
there, I would have left this painful story in oblivion,
and spared you so much humiliation. Believe me,
Mrs. Varley, <span class='it'>money</span> is not the true criterion in estimating
respectability or character, as you seem to
judge. That man is poor indeed who only possesses
heaps of shining gold, though so great he cannot count
their value—but the wealth garnered in the heart, the
gems of virtue set around the immortal soul, are the
only imperishable riches, which are the legitimate and
justifiable ambition of an imperishable nature. I will
keep your secret sacredly, as I have kept it these many
years that we have been neighbors and acquaintances.
I will only exhort you to remember, madam, that there
is nothing dishonorable in honest, laborious, physical
industry—the working with one’s hands. The fact
that my beloved Jessie toiled to provide for the comfort
of her sick and indigent parents, and discharged
with her own noble efforts all their pecuniary obligations,
only renders her more admirable in my estimation,
and worthier to receive the inheritance I feel
honored to bestow upon her. Hereafter she will be
recognized as my own daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley was perfectly subdued. The character
of the lady she had come armed to annihilate, stood
out sublimely before her, in contrast with her own
conscious duplicity and assumption—humbled and silenced
she rose to go, with very much the feeling of
an arrogant general vanquished and routed, and forced
into a disgraceful and disordered retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My pen is unequal to the description of the scene at
Mrs. Varley’s own house, when she at length reached
home, and detailed to her daughters the whole story,
and relieved the suspense of her guests, by so much
of it as related to themselves. Mrs. Tyler and Elizabeth
decided to leave in the first train the next morning,
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
bearing with them any thing but the cordiality and
good wishes of their hostess and her five daughters,
who gave the “metropolitan friends” definitely to understand
that they regarded themselves most scandalously
imposed upon, by the shabbiest of pretenders,
and that any further acquaintance would be unthought
of, which complimentary farewells the guests fiercely
retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Varley very shortly concluded that the health
of her family, which, in truth, had suffered somewhat
by their unexpected defeats, required journeying; and
in a few days the house was closed, the servants discharged,
and the household had departed, rumor said
to spend the winter in Cuba. And not long after the
citizens of N. were very much astonished by an advertisement
in the papers, stating that “the entire
establishment lately occupied by Mrs. Cynthia Varley,
deceased, would be sold at public auction on such a
day—house, grounds, furniture, plate, horses and carriages,
etc., and that the sale must be positive, for
cash.” Subsequently the melancholy report was confirmed,
that Mrs. Varley and her fair and beautiful
Charlotte were taken with violent fever on their journey
southward, and had both died. The fate of the
survivors remained in mystery, as the administrator of
the estate had no liberty to communicate their place
of residence, or their future intentions. No doubt they
chose some fashionable resort, and I fear became the
prey of fortune-hunters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Tyler, on her return to New York, found not only
that her husband was bankrupt, and his affairs in a state
of irretrievable ruin, but his mind also was a perfect
wreck, fluctuating between idiocy and insanity, but its
coloring always that of the most hopeless depression.
Jessie Lincoln’s bounty long supported him at a lunatic
asylum, while his wife and Elizabeth managed to support
themselves by the proceeds of a small millinery shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The revolution of a few years brought some interesting
changes over the society of N. Jessie Lincoln,
the faithful and dutiful daughter, became the beloved
and lovely wife of—“The Rev. Mr. Style of course!”
cries my hasty reader. “Who ever read a story
where the hero and heroine were not finally married?
it is an event to be fully anticipated.” Then, indeed,
is my tale a novel one. Be not too confident in coming
to conclusions, because precedents happen to be in
their favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessie Lincoln became the beloved and lovely wife
of Lieutenant George Jones! I do not know but she
would have married Mr. Style, if, like too many others,
he had not lingered in the vestibule of the temple of
Hymen till another hand lighted the torch, and proudly
stood beside her at the altar. The heart of Jessie Lincoln
was irrevocably given, with all its wealth of love
to the young naval officer, and the minister was left to
regret his too confident and presumptuous delay when
regrets were unavailing. But Jessie was a “mourning
bride”—for only a few weeks after her marriage,
her noble and beloved patroness sickened and died,
leaving Jessie and her husband the proprietors of her
tasteful and elegant mansion, and the principal heirs to
her estate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did Mr. Style—such a fine young man, and so
royally gifted, consign himself to a gloomy celibacy,
and live and die a bachelor—‘which being interpreted,’
is <span class='it'>half a man</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nay, reader, I’ll hasten to tell you that Emilie
Jones, that wild, hair-brained, passionate, but truly
generous and high-minded Emilie, learned lessons of
gentleness and piety, and married—because they mutually
and earnestly loved—the young clergyman of
the church of N.; and by bequest of Mrs. Tower,
the beautiful residence of the Varleys became the village
manse, and their lovely home!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is one of the indigenous tame birds which is a
favorite with the rich and noble. Its body is thick and
short. Its whole length is six inches and three-quarters,
of which the tail measures two and three-quarters;
the beak is only six lines in length, short, thick, and
black; the iris is chestnut-colored; the shanks eight
lines high, and black; the top of the head, the circle of
the beak, the chin, and beginning of the throat, are of
a beautiful velvet black; the upper part of the neck,
the back and shoulders, deep gray; the rump white;
the under part of the neck, the wide breast, and to the
centre of the belly, are of a fine vermilion, less bright,
however, in the young than old; the blackish pen-feathers
become darker toward the body; the secondaries
have the outer edge of an iron blue, which in
the hinder ones is reddish. The tail is rather forked,
and of a brilliant black, tinged with iron-blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The female is easily distinguished from the male,
for what is red on him is reddish-gray on her, while
her back is of a brownish-gray, and her feet are not so
black; she is also smaller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This species has some singular varieties; the principal
are:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The <span class='it'>White Bullfinch</span>, which is of an ashy-white,
or wholly white, with dark spots on the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The <span class='it'>Black Bullfinch</span>. These are most generally
females, which become black, either with age, when
they are only fed on hemp seed, or with having been
kept when young in a totally dark place. Some resume
at their moulting their natural colors, others remain
black; but this black is not the same in all; some
are of a brilliant raven black, others dull, and not so
dark on the belly; in some the head only is of a raven
black, the rest of the body being duller; in others the
black is mixed with red spots on the belly, or the latter
is entirely red. I have seen one in which the head
and breast, as well as the upper and under parts of the
body, were of a raven black, every other part of a dull
black, with the wings and tail white; it was a very
handsome bird, rather larger than a redbreast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The <span class='it'>Speckled Bullfinch</span>. It is thus called, for,
besides its natural colors, it is spotted with black and
white, or white and ash color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The <span class='it'>Mongrel Bullfinch</span>. It is the offspring of a
female reared in the house from the nest, and of a
male canary. Its shape and color partake of those of
the parent birds; its note is very agreeable, and softer
than that of the canary; but it is very scarce. This
union rarely succeeds; but when tried, a very ardent
and spirited canary should be chosen.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>5. The other varieties are: the <span class='it'>Large Bullfinch</span>,
about the size of a thrush, and the <span class='it'>Middling</span>, or
<span class='it'>Common</span>. As to dwarf birds, which are not as large
as a chaffinch, it is a bird-catcher’s story, for this difference
in size is observed in all kinds of birds. I can
affirm it with the more certainty, having had opportunities
every year of seeing hundreds of these birds,
both wild and tame. I have even in the same nest
found some as small as redbreasts, and others as large
as a crossbill.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Habitation.</span>—When wild, bullfinches are found
over Europe and Russia. They are particularly common
in the mountainous forests of Germany. The male
and female never separate during the whole year. In
winter they wander about everywhere in search of
buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Food.</span>—When wild the bullfinch does not often
suffer from the failure of its food; for it eats pine and
fir seeds, the fruit of the ash and maple, corn, all kinds
of berries, the buds of the oak, beech, and pear trees,
and even linseed, millet, rape, and nettle seed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the house those which run about may be fed on
the universal paste, and, for a change, rape seed may
be added; those which are taught must be fed only on
poppy seed, with a little hemp seed, and now and then
a little biscuit without spice. It has been remarked
that those which are fed entirely on rape seed soaked
in water live much longer, and are more healthy. The
hemp seed is too heating, sooner or later blinds them,
and always brings on a decline. A little green food,
such as lettuce, endive, chickweed, water-cresses, a
little apple, particularly the kernels, the berries of the
service tree, and the like, is agreeable and salutary to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Breeding.</span>—These tenderly affectionate birds can
hardly live when separated from one another. They
incessantly repeat their call with a languishing note,
and continually caress. They can sometimes be made
to breed in the house, like the canary, but their eggs
are rarely fruitful. In the wild state they breed twice
every year, each time laying from three to six eggs, of
a bluish white, spotted with violet and brown at the
large end. Their nest, which they build in the most
retired part of a wood, or in a solitary quickset hedge,
is constructed with little skill, of twigs which are
covered with moss. The young ones are hatched
in fifteen days. Those which are to be taught
must be taken from the nest when the feathers of
the tail begin to grow; and must be fed only on rape
seed soaked in water and mixed with white bread;
eggs would kill them or make them blind. Their
plumage is then of a dark ash-color, with the wings
and tail blackish-brown; the males may be known at
first by their reddish breast; so that when these only
are wished to be reared they may be chosen in the nest,
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
for the females are not so beautiful, nor so easily
taught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although they do not warble before they can feed
themselves, one need not wait for this to begin their
instruction,<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> for it will succeed better, if one may say
so, when infused with their food; since experience
proves that they learn those airs more quickly, and
remember them better, which they have been taught
just after eating. It has been observed several times,
that these birds, like the parrots, are never more attentive
than during digestion. Nine months of regular and
continued instruction are necessary before the bird acquires
what amateurs call firmness, for if one ceases
before this time, they spoil the air, by suppressing or
displacing the different parts, and they often forget it
entirely at their first moulting. In general it is a good
thing to separate them from the other birds, even after
they are perfect; because, owing to their great quickness
in learning, they would spoil the air entirely by
introducing wrong passages; they must be helped to
continue the song when they stop, and the lesson must
always be repeated whilst they are moulting, otherwise
they will become mere chatterers, which would
be doubly vexatious after having had much trouble in
teaching them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Diseases.</span>—Those bullfinches which are caught in a
snare or net are rarely ill, and may be preserved for
eight years or more; but those reared from the nest
are subject to many diseases, caused by their not having
their natural food, or by those injurious delicacies
which are always lavished on favorite birds; they
rarely live more than six years. The surest means of
preserving them healthy for a long time, is to give
them neither sweets nor tit-bits of any kind, scrupulously
to confine their food to rape seed, adding now
and then a very little hemp seed to please them, and a
good deal of the green food before mentioned. The
bottom of their cages should be covered with river
sand, as the bird there finds some stones which aid the
functions of the stomach. Their most frequent diseases
are moulting, costiveness, diarrhœa, epilepsy, grief,
and melancholy, in which case they are quite silent,
and remain immovable, unless the cause can be discovered.
They must not be given any delicacy, and
must be fed entirely on soaked rape seed. A clove in
their water, proper food, and particularly a good deal
of refreshing green food, enables them to pass the
moulting time in good health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However difficult this pairing may be, it sometimes
succeeds very well. A bullfinch and female canary once
produced five young ones, which died on a journey which
they could not bear. Their large beak, and the blackish
down with which they were covered, showed that they
were more like their father than mother.—<span class='it'>Translator.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not recommend the employment of bird organs
for instructing birds, because they are rarely accurate,
and their notes are harsh and discordant; for bullfinches
repeat the sounds exactly as they hear them, whether
harsh or false, according to the instrument used. The
good and pure whistling of a man of taste is far preferable;
the bird repeats it in a soft, flute-like tone. When one
cannot whistle well it is better to use a flageolet.—<span class='it'>Translator.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been out since early morning, rambling
amid the rough romance of the Scottish Highlands, in
the vicinity of the far-famed Loch Katrine. With Sir
Walter’s picture of that “burnished sheet of living
gold,” with its surrounding hills broken by <a id='tros'></a>trossach,
dell and valley, in my mind’s eye, I own that I felt
disappointed, as I stood upon an isolated rock at the
foot of “huge Ben-Venue,” and looked up to the
feathered crests of the eternal <span class='it'>mountains</span>, (by courtesy,)
and then gazed where Katrine</p>

<p class='noindent'>The scene <span class='it'>was</span> grand, and very beautiful, and no soul
can be more susceptible than mine to the beauties of
Nature in her solitudes of mountain, lake and woodland;
but I had expected too much. It needed the
love light of Sir Walter’s Scottish heart to give the
scenery, in my eyes, the loveliness it wore for him.
To me the rough hill, with its shingly bosom, its tufts
of heather, and ravines fringed with yellow broom,
and feathery fern—the precipitous rocks and wooded
slopes—the pebbly beach and abrupt headland—the
cloud-checkered heaven above—and the deep, clear
lake that mirrored all these in its trembling bosom,
were but as the multitudes of hills and lakes, which
every where diversify the surface of our earth. I was
disappointed, and of course inclined to underrate the
real beauty and sublimity of the grand theatre by which
we were surrounded. The enthusiastic admiration
which burst in ejaculatory phrases from my companions
became distasteful to me; and partly to relieve
my own peevishness, and partly to escape from the
distasteful demonstrations of the company, I struck
into a narrow path that wound spirally along up the
precipitous rocky tower at the base of which I had
been standing. Higher and higher I ascended, botanizing
amongst the plants and lichens, until a stone on
which I placed my foot gave way beneath the effort I
made to spring higher, and alas for my <span class='it'>excelsior</span>—after
a rapid but very rough descent, I found myself
prostrate on the pebbly beach—half buried in rubbish,
and the faithless stone that betrayed my unwary foot
lying very uncomfortably upon what should have been
my lower limbs, though at that time they were elevated
considerably above my head, fixed, as in a vice,
between a hillock of pebbles and the fallen mass of
rock. Great was my fright, greater my pain, and
greatest the consternation and alarm of my companions,
who soon extricated the fallen greatness from its perilous
position, and discovered that one of my legs was
badly fractured, and both severely crushed, while
several serious bruises, in other parts of my person,
rendered me quite helpless, and apparently in great
danger. What now was to be done? There was a
real tempest of sighs, groans, and lamentations, and no
small shower of tears; a goodly number of which fell
from the dark eyes of dear little Charlotte M’Lane, a
perfect highland fairy, who had been the joy beam of
the party, through the day; ever moving, and never
weary, glad herself, and gladdening all around her.
Now she sat amid the cloaks which were spread for
my accommodation, on a heap of gathered fern, and
supported my head in her lap, soothing, condoling, and
weeping by turns—or all together. And I, notwithstanding
my sorry plight, felt a queer kind of pleasure
in being the object of such care and solicitude, to one
so young, so lovely, and so joyous-hearted. But what
was to be done? Night was gathering her shadows
in the dells—and though the day had been fine, we began
to feel that</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There seemed no means of conveying my poor mangled
carcass along the rugged paths of that broken district,
and despair seemed gathering with the gloom of the
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just at this juncture, a young man who stood above
me on a crag burst out with a tremendous hallo-o!!
and continued to shout boisterously, and wave his
square yard of perfumed linen, with a grotesque earnestness.
It was soon apparent that he was signaling
a boat, which appeared to be crossing the lake, half a
mile above us, and which was rendered visible by</p>

<p class='noindent'>She returns my signal, cried Harry, jumping from his
eminence, and immediately roaring out that he had
sprained his ankle most unmercifully. Our comrades
drew off his boot, and using it in place of a pitcher,
commenced pouring water on the injured limb. Meantime
the boat approached us, a commodious yacht
built craft, carrying two oarsmen and a young highlander,
who realized my idea of Sir William Wallace,
for he was at once the most beautiful, noble and unconscious
creature that my eyes ever rested on. Addressing
us with a lofty and yet gentle courtesy, he
inquired in what way he could be of service to us.
Our forlorn condition was soon explained to him, and
it was speedily settled that he should convey Harry,
myself, and fairy Charlotte, to his mountain home,
while one of his boatmen should pilot the residue of
the party to the main road, where we had left our
carriages. The young Scotsman, whose name was
Malcomb Douglas, assured us that we should receive
both medical and surgical attendance at his father’s
house, where we should be welcome until we were
recovered of our injuries, or until we were pleased to
leave. My couch was speedily transferred to the bow
of the boat, and dear, lovely Charlotte was soon again
burdened with my languid head, for by this time I was
both dispirited and faint. I took no note of the voyage,
except that our benefactor took the place at the oar of
him whom he had sent as guide to our party; and long
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
before we landed the night was dark, for the young
moon, which shed a trembling radiance on the opposite
mountain shore, left our side of the deep, dark
water in a blacker shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length we landed, and I had become so stiff and
sore, from my undrest injuries, that I lost my consciousness
as they lifted me from the boat, and on the
ninth day after, awoke to find myself in a magnificently
furnished room, lying in a bed which might have beseemed
a monarch, while near my pillow, in an antique
velvet-cushioned easy-chair, reclined my fairy
Charlotte, in a deep but apparently troubled sleep. I
soon recollected all that had befallen me, except the
lapse of time since the memorable night, and thinking
that we had recently arrived, did not wonder that
Charlotte had sunk under her fatigue. So I composed
myself to sleep and kept her company in the land of
dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I awoke again. It was still night, at least it seemed
so in that darkened apartment, but I could distinguish
the rich and heavy ornaments of the walls and ceiling,
and the sumptuous embroidery of the heavy tapestries,
which swept from the lofty cornice to the floor; the
antique chair also stood by the bedside, but its late
occupant was not there. I moved, and raised my head
somewhat from the pillow, when from the concealment
of my bed-curtain came forward a stately lady,
apparently fifty years of age, wearing a rich dress of
black satin, and holding a small golden night-lamp in
her hand. She looked earnestly into my eyes a moment,
and then with a gentle grace, which betrayed
no surprise or other emotion, she inquired how I had
rested, and if I found myself better of my wounds.
I replied that I felt quite well, when she shook her
head, bade me be quiet, and took her seat in the vacant
chair. Presently Charlotte stole softly into the room
from a curtained recess, and meeting my smile of recognition,
uttered a cry of joy, laughed, danced, wrung
her hands, and finally wept like an infant, despite all
the efforts of the dark-robed lady to quiet her transports.
I now discovered that I had been a week delirious,
and considered in a very precarious condition;
that Harry was nearly well, and that he and Charlotte
had been my constant attendants, aided by the lady
present, and other members of her household. Soon
after a silvery haired old man, came to my bedside,
and being introduced as my physician, congratulated
me with courteous politeness on the favorable change
in my condition, adding that with proper care my recovery
would be certain and speedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you ever enjoy the luxury of an easy convalescence,
surrounded by every comfort, and attended
by a smiling beauty, and jovial young companion?
What Elysium-like dreams employ the languid fancy—and
what a world of impossibilities gather around
us, like tangible and familiar things. I dreamed of a
life of love and joy with fairy Charlotte. I would win
her, and bear her like a rich trophy to my transatlantic
home. Oh! we would be so happy. How would
her buoyancy of spirit enhance all my joys; and her
ready sympathy, how it would soothe my sorrows;
and then what a nurse she would be, whenever I was
ill. She liked me, that was certain; of course I could
win her love, and then my happiness was secure. And
I indulged in all the passionate vagaries of love dreaming,
until I felt that unconnected with Charlotte there
was for me no futurity. Thus passed one week more,
and then I was permitted to occupy the cushioned
chair, and sit by the open window. It was singular
that I had felt so little curiosity respecting my host,
and the singularity of surrounding objects, but my
love fancies had fully occupied my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as I sat at the casement, which extended from
floor to ceiling, and had no other protection for the
crystal crown-glass than the clinging vines without,
and the embroidered tapestries within, and looked out
upon the wild scenery, apparently uninvaded by the
hand of cultivation, which substitutes the useful for
the beautiful, the production of Art for the sublimity of
Nature, I felt the awakening of a thousand wonders,
as to where I was, and with whom, and how the
wealth of that chamber found its way to that singularly
hidden spot; and who was the stately lady who
occasionally came to my bedside; and how such a
man as Malcomb Douglas came to be an inhabitant of
those mountain wilds? I had seen him but seldom,
since I regained my consciousness, but his manners
were perfect, and his conversation displayed unconsciously
the treasures of a rare and richly cultivated
intellect. He seemed a being altogether above the
level of mankind. It would have seemed absurd to
fancy him talking nonsense, discussing fashions, or inquiring
what he would get for dinner. Yet he was
not ignorant or unmindful of the courtesies, and little
conventionalities of life—but he seemed to hold them
of no moment, and give no thought to such trifles—which
came to him intuitively, and as belonging to
daily intercourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I thus mused, gazing down upon the lake, and
away to the opposite hills, I observed, shooting out
from behind an abrupt headland, a beautiful little sail-boat,
in which stood Malcomb Douglas, and which,
coming round the point, ran into a white pebbled bay,
just in front of and beneath my window; and then
from a clump of <a id='haz'></a>hazels emerged my idol, Charlotte,
supported by no other than Harry Heath, who, it then
occurred to me, had mentioned in the morning that he
should take my gentle nurse out for a little exercise, as
she was suffering from her close attendance upon me.
She was beautiful in the distance, but as she clung to
Harry’s arm, and looked up familiarly into his face, I
felt a pang of jealousy, the first that had ever wrung
my bosom. They stepped into the boat, and sat down
together, and the little craft, as if proud of her freight,
put off gallantly along the shining water. And Charlotte
would be by Harry’s side—how long?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear you are in great pain,” came in anxious, inquiring
tone upon my ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started—my jealous feelings were living on my
face. “Just a little twinge,” I said, “occasioned by
shifting my position indiscreetly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should be very careful,” returned the good
man who had been my surgeon and doctor from the
first, and who now advanced, examined the position
of my fractured limb, and took a seat beside me at
the window. “How gallantly yon little boat holds
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
her way, with her living freight of beauty, love and
happiness,” he murmured, as if communing with himself;
“and yet a single blast of the mountain storm
may whelm her, with all her warm young hopeful
heart, deep down in the cold weltering waves.” He
finished with a deep sigh, and a cold shudder ran
through my frame, in response to his fearful words.
“Do not let me make you melancholy,” he said, after
a pause; “but I am an old man, and have endured
many sorrows, and have grown distrustful of the promises
of happiness. Reverses come so unexpectedly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said I, timidly, “that the owners of this
mansion must have known some strange reverse of
fortune. It seems so singular to find the manners of a
court, and the luxury of a palace, in a rough stone
mountain dwelling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman looked earnestly in my face a
moment. “I have never spoken of these things to any
one,” he said, “but if you feel interested, I will tell
you a tale, to beguile the time until the return of your
companions. Fifty years ago—for I am now seventy-eight—the
lady whom you have seen in this chamber
was the loveliest creature that ever existed out of
heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty years!” I exclaimed, “why she is not more
than fifty years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So any stranger would suppose,” was the quiet
reply; “but she is near seventy. But fifty years ago
she was young, and lovely, and joyous; more, she was
the only and idolized daughter of a princess of the
realm, whose foreign lord fell in battle, having never
seen his infant child. The widowed princess lived in
seclusion, though in the neighborhood of a court; and
though her daughter, the Lady Anna, received every
advantage in the way of education, she was never presented
at court, or allowed to mingle with courtly
society. And, indeed, she seemed to feel no desire for
ostentatious display or admiration, but rather delighted
in the quiet of domestic life, and the unceremonious
intercourse of confiding friendship. I will not tell you
whose son I am, but I was not deemed an unsuitable
companion for the royally-descended Lady Anna.
My sister was the friend and confident of the princess,
and I was a privileged visiter at her palace-home, and
much in the society of her daughter from her childhood.
I am an old man now, but then I was a boy,
and had a young, ardent heart. I cannot tell when I
first loved the Lady Anna. It seems that I loved her
from eternity. She was always perfect in my estimation.
Her actions were precisely what I would
have dictated, and her words, the expression of my
heartfelt sentiments. And then she was so beautiful—so
truly beautiful. Not pretty; any young girl may be
so dressed and ornamented as to appear pretty—and
we frequently hear of styles of beauty; but true beauty
is independent of dress or adornment; you adore it, not
because it is tastefully arrayed, but because it is of
itself adorable. I have seen ladies receiving homage
as belles and beauties, who, in homely attire, and
engaged in household toils, would have been really repulsive;
but Lady Anna would have been entrancingly
beautiful in any dress, or at any occupation; and notwithstanding
her royal descent and superior attainment,
she was gentle, unassuming, and of a loving and
confiding nature. To me she was always frank and
like a loving sister; and, oh, I was happy, perfectly
happy in the possession of her pure regards. I had
not thought of a change in our relations, of an interruption
of our intercourse, of a separation—<span class='it'>never</span>! I
felt as if we should live on, for and with each other
forever. Every place where she had been was hallowed;
every thing that she had touched, sacred in my
estimation; and whatsoever she had looked upon was
dear to my eye, and I felt that the light of her glance
rested upon it. All my thoughts, and words, and deeds,
had reference to her, and her approval was the whole
aim of my life; and yet the selfish thought of appropriating
her to myself, of making her <span class='it'>mine</span>, was no
part of my soul’s worship. To be near her, to see her,
and to hear her voice, was enough for my young
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was fifteen, and I three-and-twenty, when my
guardians resolved to send me as confidential secretary
to the minister to Sweden. I ought to have felt myself
honored by this appointment, but I felt only an
agony of grief. To go away from Lady Anna, and all
the places where we had been together, was a trial
which almost made me frantic. But I could not decline
the appointment—I must depart. The affair was
so sudden, and I had so little time for preparation, that
I found no opportunity for a private interview with
Lady Anna. She expressed deep regret at our approaching
separation, but I felt, and keenly, that her
sorrow was not like mine, not the desolation of soul
that made the day dark and the night sleepless to me.
Then I longed to tell her all my love—then I felt that
I would have her all my own; and then I doubted for
the first time the existence in her bosom of a love answering
to my own. And in this state of mind the day
of departure found me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You will write by every opportunity,’ she said,
as I held her hand in my tremulous grasp. Her voice
was low and sad, and as she looked into my face,
tears gushed over her long eyelashes and fell large and
bright upon her bosom. My soul was a whirlwind.
I prest her hand to my lips, and hastened with unsteady
steps from her presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three years—only three years—and yet they
seemed three ages, was I a wanderer in stranger lands.
I did write whenever I found opportunity—but opportunities
were not so frequent fifty years ago as they
are at present. So my missives were few, and only
twice in those three years was my heart delighted by
the receipt of a letter from Lady Anna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet and gentle were her words, like those of a
loving sister, and yet they did not satisfy my spirit. I
longed for one passionate regret, one ardent expression
of hope for our reunion, one sentence that evidently
gushed involuntarily from a devoted heart. These
were not in her letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When it was announced to me that we were
speedily to turn us homeward, my heart leaped up
with a great bound, and then seemed to sink, pulseless,
in my bosom. It was an agony like death; and from
that hour until we landed on our native shore, my mind
was a perfect chaos, or rather a tumult of opposite and
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
contending emotions. Joy was fettered by apprehension;
hope was throttled by deadly fear, and doubt,
like a strong giant armed, beat back every ray of
gladness, every beam of joyous anticipation, every
spirit that dared to whisper of happiness to come. I
thought of every event that might have occurred
during the three years of my absence—of death—change—misfortune—and
I almost wished for death,
rather than the knowledge that awaited me; and yet
I knew not what was in store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I arrived. The white cliffs—the silver beach—the
green shore of my native land, were all unchanged.
The majestic Thames was all the same as when last
I passed adown its tide; the mighty city, with its
towers and palaces, gleamed in the sunlight, as it had
done since my boyhood. <span class='it'>There was no change.</span> My
soul became calm, and as I traced the old familiar
streets, and looked up to the well known buildings and
paused in the shadow of the well-remembered trees,
my heart became joyous, and I sped on to the abode of
my dear and only sister. I should hear of Lady Anna
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did hear. The princess had fallen into a decline.
A sojourn in Italy had been named as her only chance
of recovery, and to Italy she had gone, accompanied,
certainly, by her only child, the Lady Anna. They
had been gone nearly a year, and I need not tell you,
that as soon as I could make arrangements, I followed
them to that far-famed lovely land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were at Pisa. I found them there. Our
meeting was full of gladness—but <span class='it'>they were changed</span>.
The princess was wholly subdued by pain and weakness.
She was attenuated in person, and the lofty
expression of her face was softened by a look of meek
endurance. Her voice was low, and her smile—it
came seldom—was sad, exceedingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Lady Anna, anxiety and watching had taken
away the buoyancy of her person, and the sunlight of
her spirit. She received me joyfully; but ere the first
interview was over, I detected a restlessness, a sort of
watching and insecurity in her eye and manner which
had no reference to me, and for which I accounted by
referring to the precarious state of her only parent’s
health. Several times that day I observed her eyes
fixed on her mother’s face, and dimmed with gathering
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I discovered that here, as at home, she lived in
seclusion, never mingling with the gay world, and I
sought to draw her into society, with a view to divert
her mind from its sadness. ‘I cannot join the dance,
or listen to sweet music,’ she replied, ‘while my
dear mother is suffering at home.’ I however persuaded
her to go with me to some of the public exhibitions
of the beautiful in art. We had visited several
galleries, cabinets and churches; we had stood side by
side, wrapt in awe or admiration; we had walked together
amongst the sweet breathed flowers, and beneath
the shadowy trees; we had stood upon the sea-coast,
when the stars looked down upon their trembling
images in the deep mirroring waters; we had
looked together on many entrancing beauties of Nature
as well as of Art; and I had felt my soul struggling
to pour out before her the treasures of the inner
temple of its love, but a something in her manner restrained me—I
could not tell her of a passionate love.
Now she was unto me as a loving sister—a declaration
would change the relation between us, I knew not
if for joy or sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mournful day arrived. The princess, who was
forgotten by her country, fell unexpectedly asleep to
awaken no more till the heavens pass away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Anna arose from the heavy blow, and assumed
a calm melancholy of demeanor. Yet, to my
surprise, she spoke not of returning home. Months
passed, and we were still at Pisa. Lady Anna suffering
from an uneasiness which she could not conceal,
and which at times broke forth in fits of passionate
weeping, and again showed itself in almost sullen
silence, or something akin to peevishness. The balance
of her fine mind was evidently disturbed. She had a
sorrow which she had not confided to my love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were walking pensively along one of those glorious
avenues, shadowed by tall, dark leaved trees, one
fine June morning, when we saw a gay party, in open
carriages, advancing from the country. Lady Anna,
as usual, drew her veil over her lovely face, and walked
on without evincing any curiosity, but I recognised
some of the party, whom I had seen abroad, and directing
her attention to a particular vehicle, the most
magnificent in the <a id='cort'></a><span class='it'>cortège</span>, I whispered, ‘there is a
lady whom I have heard you wish to see—the Princess
L——. Is she not lovely? And her husband is a
noble looking man. Did you ever see his equal?’ I
turned to Lady Anna, expecting her reply. She stood
still, and as I touched her hand I started—it was cold
and rigid as the hand of a corpse. I lifted her veil,
and my heart grew cold with fear and wonder. Her
face was white as death, and the features were fixed
in an expression of the most intense agony. The carriages
had all passed by, and there she stood, apparently
changed to marble. I spoke to her, I entreated
her to speak or move, and at length the tension of her
nerves gave way, and she sunk powerless in my
arms. A vehicle chanced that way, and I lifted her
in, and bore her to her hotel. Sixteen hours she lay
with no sign of life, except an almost imperceptible
breathing, and then she rallied, lifted her head from
the pillow, and looked wildly round the room, then
clenching her hands together, she burst into a passion
of lamentation and bitter weeping. I never witnessed
distress equal to hers. She cried aloud, and her tears
came not in drops, but flowed in continuous streams,
and every sob seemed as if it had torn her heart
asunder. I dreaded that she would suffocate in that
tempest of agony. But she turned from my attempts
to soothe, and wept on until her strength was utterly
exhausted. She did not rise from her bed until several
weeks were past, and then she was more like a corpse
than a living woman. The bloom never came back to
her cheek, the smile to her lip, or the lustre to her eye.
She spoke not of the day, or the cause to the commencement
of her illness—and I did not presume to
ask any explanation. On the commencement of her
illness I had taken rooms adjoining hers, and now I
frequently heard her walking to and fro in her chamber
a great portion of the night. It was a clear, starry
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
midnight, one of those holy seasons when the earth is
dark, and the atmosphere too transparent to be luminous,
when we look away into the clear ether, and
almost comprehend the immense distances to the bright
distant disc of the innumerable stars. I was sleepless,
and stood at my casement looking out upon earth and
heaven. There was a knock at my door. I turned
and admitted the Lady Anna. Pale she was, as usual,
but she seemed unusually agitated. I besought her to
be seated, and to honor me with her commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Godolphin,’ she said, solemnly, ‘tell me the name
and title of the man whom we saw seated beside the
Princess L⁠——?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Surely his name is no secret,’ I said; ‘all Europe
knows him—he is king of ——.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Swear this to me,’ she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Poor lady,’ I ejaculated mentally, ‘she is deranged’—but
I swore the oath prescribed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now listen,’ she continued; ‘this king, under an
assumed name, sought me in my seclusion, won my
love—my <span class='it'>love</span>, I say,—and we were privately married,
more than two years ago. I need not repeat the
sophistries by which he persuaded me that he had imperious
reasons for a temporary concealment, reasons
which I should one day know, and which I must approve.
My mother’s illness rendered it easy to elude
her suspicion, and when you came, we still kept our
secret. He was generally absent from Pisa, on pretence
of business—but I saw him frequently. I was
expecting a visit from him daily when we met him on
that fatal walk. I have not seen him since, though he
has implored an interview, if but for five minutes. I
will never see him more.’ And a wail of anguish,
which no words could utter, struggled up from her
broken heart. I essayed to speak. ‘No, no,’ she said,
‘I have not finished. I am dead to the world. Let it
be understood that I lie with my mother. Would to
God it were so, indeed. You will serve me. I know
you will. Provide for me, then, a retreat, where
none who ever knew me may hear of me again. I
have contemplated death—suicide; but I will live to
weep, and pray, and suffer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what words for my ear were these. I felt to
thank heaven that the darkness enabled me to hide
my emotions from her, for my suffering was terrible.
I felt light and hope, earth and heaven, at once annihilated.
When she declared that she had loved another,
my heart died within my bosom. It has never since
throbbed as it was wont to throb at every thought of
her. I no longer loved, but existence had become a
void. The fair temple of my youth, with its idol, and
all its beautiful treasures, was at once swept away, and
the dark flood rolled sluggishly where my joys had
been. I felt, not agony, but desolation; not regret, but
cold despair. But I would live for her sake—she was
miserable, and I could assist her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I bethought me of this ancient castle, which
had been a stronghold of my ancestors, and had fallen
greatly to decay. I offered to repair it, and bring her
hither. She thanked me warmly, and I came and
commenced my repairs. I had always loved this
glorious Highland scenery, where the mountains lie
forever watching the reflection of their magnificent
features in the mirroring lake below, as if watching
the lights and shadows on their rugged brows, and
the graceful floating of the tresses of yellow broom,
bound and crowned with the dark wreathing heather,
shining with sunlight, or gemmed with drops of dew,
or the diamonds of the summer shower. And when
the summer is old, and like a forsaken woman, casts
her ornaments from her with showers of tears and
heavy sighing; the mountains seem to watch the fall
of the verdure on the bosom of the waters, until they
see the splendor of the wintry stars forming a diadem
around their snow-crested heads. These scenes of
sublime beauty, I judged, were well calculated to
soothe the tumult in both our spirits; and here, where
the breezes whisper to each other across the deep,
narrow dell, I formed a little paradise of fruit trees and
glowing shrubs, and furnished these rough halls with
the sumptuousness of a palace; and then I brought
Lady Anna and her infant daughter home. To my
household I presented her as my sister, and a widow;
and their Scottish hearts received her with a ready
sympathy, and respected a sorrow which seemed to
them so natural and commendable. To those who
had known her, I said the Lady Anna is no more.
The loss of her mother broke her gentle heart. My
heart was dead, yet I regarded her as a dear sister;
and to this day she knows not that I ever felt more
for her than a brother’s love. And now that we were
all the world to each other, I enjoyed a calm that
seemed very like happiness. Her child, the little Lady
Adela, soon engrossed our warmest affections; she
was a sweet and lovely child, but no way like her
mother. She had clear blue eyes, fair curling hair in
rich abundance, a complexion of transparent pink and
white, and though delicately formed, she was plump
and exquisitely moulded. Her intellect was wonderful,
yet she was a simple-minded, loving and confiding
child. She grew to be a part of my being. Her
mother hardly loved her more than I. Her education
was our delight—she was so docile, so quick to receive
instruction. Earth hath been graced with very few
like her. The beautiful bud became a flower, yet she
seemed more pure and spiritual than in her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘If I might ask one boon for my child,’ said Lady
Anna, one evening, as we were speaking of Lady
Adela’s future prospects. ‘If I might obtain one boon
for her, I would pray that she might never feel the
pulse of human love.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Lady Anna, her experience had been bitter—and
mine, I could have answered, Amen, to her prayer.
But a lone traveler craved hospitality at our postern.
He was handsome, noble, and virtuous. Adela learned
to reply to the love which grew up in his heart for her.
It was a dreadful trial to our doating hearts, but we
gave her, with our blessing, to her beloved, and put
bonds upon our feelings, when she bade a sobbing
farewell, and left her own dear home for a splendid
station in the queenly city of Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The knowledge that she was happy in her new
home, was a sweet solace to our <a id='lone'></a>loneliness; and when,
in less than two years, she came with her fine young
boy to spend the time of the summer heat with us, we
were supremely happy. Womanhood had not dimmed
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
the gladness of her heart, or withered the flowers of
her childish glee and affection. Wisdom had come to
her, unaccompanied by sadness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toward autumn her young husband arrived, to
spend a few days and take her with him home. There
was a gay party assembled in these old halls, and
for days there was feasting, and mirth, and music, excursions
on the hills, and parties on the water. It was
a lovely afternoon in the fitful September. The two
boats were manned, and the barge provided with implements
and tackle for fishing, took the gentlemen on
board, while the ladies accompanied them in the lighter
and more elegant sail-boat. They shoved out from the
shore, with music and shouts and laughter. We wished
them a joyful sail, and turned to our avocations of preparation
for the evening meal and entertainment of the
party. We sighed as we thought how soon we should
be left to the old silence and loneliness. Our preparations
were completed—the day was drawing to a close.
I found Lady Anna at this very casement, looking out
upon the lake, watching for the return of our beloved.
I took the station I now occupy, but my eyes rested on
my silent companion’s face. She did not look at me,
and I gazed unchecked until the past, with all its
shadows rose up around me. I trembled in every
nerve, and felt the waters of the <a id='swol'></a>swollen heart rise
tingling to my eye-lids. I knew not what possessed
me, but I felt as if I must kneel before her, and confess
all the passion, the presumption of my youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look! look!’ she cried, ‘they come!’ and far up at
the point of yonder noble bluff, I beheld the boats heading
toward home. Just at that moment came a low growl
upon a fitful gust, and instinctively we turned our eyes
toward the west. Black, billowy clouds were surging
and heaving above the mountain crest like a stormy
ocean, and down that rugged gorge the dusky masses
of mist came turmoiling like giants wrestling in the
death-struggle, and the winds groaned and shrieked
adown the defile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Anna grew white—I had seen her so once
before; my own heart grew heavy with a pain like
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, God! Oh, merciful God!’ came from Lady
Anna’s still lips, in accents of heart-piercing agony.
If they could but outstrip the storm; if they could but
near the coast before it leapt upon the lake. It was
evident that they knew the danger, and exerted all
their powers; the boats glided swiftly over the smooth,
black surface of the water, which lay as if concentrating
itself to meet the onset of the aerial force. Our
eyes turned from the boats to the upheaving storm;
our souls were aghast in the horrible suspense—fear—dread—extreme
terror—held hope in a throttling grasp;
more than our lives were at stake, and we were
powerless—utterly powerless to retard the danger or
aid the souls in peril. We could only stand here, and
gaze with wide-open, glazed eyes upon the scene. Oh,
I think I see it now re-enacting before me. The light
sail-boat led in the race, and with our telescope we
could distinguish our child standing upright in the bow,
her face raised, as if watching the portentous clouds,
and her white hands clasped over the black mantle that
covered her bosom. At the tiller of the barge stood
her husband, while the sturdy rowers strove to keep
pace with the flight of the sail-boat; and so they sped
on to escape, if possible, the tornado which lay growling
like a couchant lion, ready to leap in its irresistible
fury upon them. The dark billows of the cloud lay
high above yon mountain wall, but for a time they
seemed to make no progress, or rather to sink back
upon themselves. How our hearts panted and stretched
toward our treasures, as if we would draw them from
the peril. As they were coming from that point, and
the storm rising over that eminence, you will perceive
that the wind would take them broadside, and
thus greatly increase their danger. You see that all
along the opposite shore there is no safe landing place,
and they were far out on the lake when they first perceived
the clouds rising above the heights. Then
there was no time for thought or reflection, and they
seemed to imagine that their only chance was to reach
the shelter of these heights before the wind should intercept
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During the temporary lull of the storm, a trembling
angel, almost hope, hovered over us. Our souls went
out toward the mariners, every dip of their oars fell
upon our distended hearts, striking thence a quick gasp,
and a pulse of pain—and thus we stood, the gathering
darkness falling like a mountain veil between us and
the objects of our anguished solicitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God! what a blaze of lightning rent the gloom,
and pierced, like a shower of flashing poniards, soul
and sense; while a clang, as of the rending to atoms
of an iron mountain, stunned our ears. Then the
storm spread its black wings, and sprang like a fierce
vulture from the heights, leaving a line of lurid red between
it and the horizon. The crisis was at hand.
Were the boats within the shelter of the land? They
were nearing our side of the lake rapidly. We could
not breathe. At that moment our Adela, who had not
moved since we first descried her, lifted her hands to
heaven with an expression of the most agonized despair—and
now the doom fell. With the rush and roar
of a cataract the wind came down upon the lake. It
met the water <span class='it'>between us and the boats</span>. The spray
went up to heaven. Lady Anna sunk back with a
shuddering groan. The lake was a tumult of warring
elements. Fierce winds, waters, thunder and wrestling
flames contending in a horrid turmoil. I turned away
and sunk upon my knees beside the mother, whose
heart felt upon its quivering chords the death-agony of
the dear one who was perishing in the boiling waves.
My soul was benumbed with horror; I had no word
of hope for her, and there was no consolation. I lifted
her form and held her to my heart, with only one
wish, that then and there we might die together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tremulous voice of the old man ceased, and for
a while he wept like a stricken woman. At length
he resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were lost—all lost. A few fragments of the
boats was all we ever found. That storm made
many mourners beside ourselves. Widows and orphans,
young girls and aged parents, wept the buried
in the water. We all sought to sustain each other;
and Lady Anna and myself were sustained not merely
by a submissive dependence upon Jehovah, but by the
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
sense of a responsibility toward our lost Adela’s infant
son. He has been our care, our hope, our pride. You
can testify that there are few equals for Malcomb
Douglas—that is his baptismal name. His father’s
name and title may one day be borne by him, and receive
more honor than, noble as they are, they can
confer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not why I have told you these things, except
it be that our identity may not perish. I will
give you on this card our real names, and, as in the
revolutions of nations, the forgotten are remembered,
and the lost found, you may sometime hear of us
honorably, or read our story on the half fabulous page
of national history. But I thought not of these things.
When I saw the gay young party put off an hour ago,
it brought the past so vividly to my mind, that I felt
constrained to tell you how the pure may be deceived—how
the virtuous may suffer, how the noble may
shrink into obscurity, how the world’s idols may be
forgotten; and, most of all, that nobility, education,
moral greatness and purity, with all gentle virtues and
all lofty aspirations, may exist in retirement, unknown
and unregarded by a world that should be proud to
wear them as jewels upon its bosom. But He that
doeth all things well, will reward every man according
to his works. So let it be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked the old gentleman amid the tears that I
could not restrain; and he expressed his gratitude for
my sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew not what effect his story wrought upon me,
but I forgot both my love and my jealously; and heard
the announcement of Charlotte M’Lane’s engagement
to Harry Heath with real pleasure. I left the hospitable
mansion of my illustrious host and hostess with
deep regret, impressed with the dignity of virtue, and
the importance of a firm trust in the goodness and wisdom
of the Ruler of the Universe. I have since heard
the name of young Malcomb heralded by the voice of
fame, and trust that his career will be one of <a id='para'></a>unparalleled
usefulness and splendor.</p>

<div><h1><a id='path'></a>THE TWO PATHS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. MARY B. HORTON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord of all things planted a garden at the foot
of the hill of life. It was like a flowered plain. The
heavens wore a gentle smile, and the earth was fresh
and green, with no deadness of stalk or stem upon
flowers or trees. The shout of glad, young voices
made its music as birds made the music of the air, and
merry troops danced with a lightness peculiar to that
garden of joy, over the soft yielding turf from which
no serpent’s sting ever came forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweet fountains gushed up in shady places, where
the happy ones rested from their play, and beautiful
vistas opened on every side, formed of bright garlands,
which fell on the brows of the childish throng like
crowns. Through the clustering branches of ever-budding
trees the bright light glanced, excepting when
a transient cloud passed over, leaving dew-jewels
sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the garden of infancy—those clouds the
fleeting sorrows of childish hearts which leaves the
tear upon the smiling cheek. The fountains in the
shady places were those of sinless memory—the vistas
were Hope’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Angels on busy wings swept over the beautiful
place, watching, as messengers of the Great Throne,
the doings of these young creatures, who in the garden
of love and peace knew not the roughness of the road
which lay beyond its mossy boundaries. From time
to time these angels caught a sweet one from the
dancing crowd, and bore it tenderly to the bosom of
the “Well Beloved.” And such were blessed; for
they had only known the joy of their garden home—their
feet had never toiled through the dust of that
hilly way rising beyond the plain. A line of glistening
wings was thus kept up between the garden and the
Throne, by the passing up of angels with their beautiful
gifts; and the groups thus broken in upon were
taught to grieve not for sweet companions so well beloved
of Heaven, so that their sunny sports went on
with but a momentary shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentle lamb and heavenly dove nestled against
the breast of fondling little ones, or answered to their
call as if their mate’s. With Hope’s garlands on their
brows, and their feet sandaled with flowers, the dancers
counted not time, as those on the outer hill counted it,
by hours, but let it make its annual rounds unnoticed,
until the period arrived for them to leave the pure retreat.
Time was to them no gray-haired tyrant with
a warning hour-glass, but a kind friend laden ever
with roses and smiles. It beckoned them to play, it
beckoned them to rest, and they saw not the different
face and burden it sometimes bore until they had gone
out beyond the gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon a mossy bank in this garden of infancy lay an
infant boy. Its chubby, dimpled hands played with the
flowers of innocence and joy that grew luxuriantly in
that pure atmosphere. The light of that blessed place
danced in his eyes, and its sweet music was succeeded
by his tiny shout. While he thus lay, a little girl stole
out from a playful group, and gliding to his side threw
her fond arms around him and kissed his beaming face
with the quick love of a warm heart. The baby
pressed his face against his sister’s with an answering
lovingness, and passed his fingers through her curling
hair with a low laugh of happiness, echoed with the
maturity of two summer’s longer life, by the little one
bending over him. How holy a thing was the love
they bore each other, and how stainless were their
souls as each answered to the other in purity and joy.
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
The angels rested on their clear wings to write upon
their foreheads “of such is the kingdom of heaven,”
and rejoiced that they were appointed guardians over
them, to whisper good when evil tempted them upon
the outer hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the older ones even in that peaceful place
looked out upon the hill with longing for the journey.
They saw the continuous band of youths and maidens
going out from the garden gates, and longed to reach
the age which was to free them from the gentle laws
of their garden nursery. Oh, how sad was the reasoning
which had led to this desire—how sure the pleasures
of that sweet place they dwelt in—how bitter
might be the anticipated delights of the Hill of Life.
The gay crowds hurrying up the hilly way seemed in
the distance like a merry company with no care or
pain. Their shouts and songs came on the breeze like
the gushings of sunny hearts knowing no cloud. The
listening ears of the waiting ones inside the gates
heard not the sighs which broke from gifted spirits,
they caught not the silent prayer of the weary and
broken-hearted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby boy had grown to take his place in the
line of youths who were to leave forever the home of
childhood and its innocent delights. His sister was
by his side, and on their dear young heads an invisible
hand was laid blessingly, as they stepped out upon the
dusty way. They had left their home of joy, they
were to walk evermore upward, upward, through
unknown snares and by the borders of dreadful depths.
Yet their hearts beat hopefully and strong, and the first
day’s travel was so easy and so new, that they mourned
not for the childish sports of the garden left behind,
and gayly looked forward to their life-long pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flowers they found in their way somewhat resembling
those their infant hands had plucked, and sweet
voices fell upon their ears which sounded quite as holy
as those in their first home. They talked together of
the teachings they had so often listened to, of the
warnings they had been impressed with, as the time
drew near for them to leave the garden gates. In
their young wisdom they believed their guardian
teachers had looked with perverted eyes upon the
travelers of the hill, and with over earnest zeal had
given them too dark a character. They had spoken
of serpents hidden beneath the grass—of snares like a
mine laid out under flowery beds. They had painted
false smiles, and spoken of honeyed words spoken
to deceive. They had prayed that the guileless
travelers would allow themselves no chain which
might seem to be of flowers, but would prove to be
of iron, eating deep wounds into the soul. What
could they have meant by all these pictures and all
these prayers? The way had been as yet but short,
yet surely as they looked up, the same appearance of
ease and joy broke on them. They still walked hand
in hand, still loved such flowers as they loved in the
plain beneath, still looked toward the Throne at morning
and at night as their eyes had ever been led to do.
Their ministering angels still followed them on wings
of joy, because they walked so pure and lovingly, and
would have spread their brightness round them to
have kept off evil forever, if their Lord had not given
to these travelers of the hill a work for their own
hearts, which, if “well done,” would meet with a most
bountiful reward. Prayer, in time of danger from a
false step or slippery way, would bring their willing
aid, but prayer must first be warmly breathed to show
a holy faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On, on they went, guarding their days by morning
adoration, and bringing by their evening supplication
sweet rest to their feet and beautiful visions to their
hearts. They had been told that at a certain point
two ways met, of which they must choose the right or
left. And soon they found themselves surrounded by
a hesitating crowd at the entrance of the paths. The
narrow one had for its guide-post the holy book of
their Lord, with opened page, from which, in golden
characters, spoke forth—“The way to Heaven.” At
the entrance of the other was a figure, the body concealed
with flowers, but the face exposed. The eyes
were of ravishing delight, and the mouth dropped
musical and melting tones, which to that company of
inexperienced youth seemed like the sweet promises
of heavenly joy. She told of beautiful and social
scenes, prepared in lovely places all along the roomy
and cheerful way she would lead them through. She
spoke with smiling lightness of the dull routine of
duties and unexciting pleasures of the path which so
few choose, and pointed gayly with tempting finger to
the laughing crowds treading the broad way of which
she was the queen—and what a queen! So fair of face,
so full of joyousness, so innocent of speech. She spoke
of the Great Father who was the lord of all upon that
hill, and with delicious earnestness pleaded for the hearts
of that young company, because their lord would not
condemn their feet for dancing on the flowers she would
strew along their path. He would not be so cruel-hearted
as to frown upon His children’s joy. Oh! how
the company of angels, who hovered round, watched
for the decisive step of the young creatures they had
followed from the garden walls. Some had hid their
faces in their bright wings for grief, when they had
seen the cherished beings of the innocent home choose
the left hand path which their heavenly natures knew
would lead to Death. Yet, with faces veiled, they followed
the deluded ones, in hopes to win them back
before they strayed too far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what was our brother’s and sister’s choice?
The boy looked wistfully toward the glittering throng,
which danced and laughed amid the wreaths and
brilliant artificial light of the broad way, but followed
his sister’s guidance toward the path whose light was
from the Throne. The angels, whose care they were,
rejoiced, and followed with a low song of triumph the
holy travelers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, through love for his dear friend, murmured
not for a time at the calm and peaceful way they trod.
But his imagination, naturally so vivid and bright, had
nothing to revel in as they walked upward side by side
with holy men and pure, who sung the praises of the
Good King as they rose toward the crown. This
crown glittered upon the summit of the hill as a promise
of eternal rest and joy for the unmurmuring and
patient traveler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the heart of the young man became listless; and
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
his eyes became dull to see the lustre of the crown as
it shone fast by the Lord’s high throne. From discontent
he went to murmuring. His sister and his
angel whispered loving words to the clouded heart, and
sought earnestly to win it back to feel the beauty of
the journey they had commenced so joyfully. But no!
the distant sound of mirth, the distant glitter of fine
sights, and spectacles appearing so ingenious and rare,
caught his wandering senses at every turn. His quiet
journey became a burden to him. His sister’s face
became a sad reproach. The crown looked dim upon
the summit. To his changed eye the holy men and
women walked like monks and nuns in solemn company.
His excited fancy would make it seem injustice
that the Lord who made the way, should have had its
pavement so hard and rough, when the broader path
was carpeted with flowers, which could yield to the
bounding foot so gently, and ever be so fresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More and more the prospect changed to his changed
eyes. The ascent now was steep and wearisome, and
oh! how the sad, sweet face of his garden friend, the
sister of his childhood passed on the mossy banks, how
it looked upon him longingly, as if the pilgrimage even
in the narrow way would be half sorrowful if he went
not up with her to the end. His angel shone from her
eyes its look of pleading, but all were lost upon the
evil-awakened youth, who saw no stars in that pure
heaven, no guide in that pleasant way worth following.
More and more as his heart gave up the treasures of
its infancy, the revel of the other path broke on his
ear. His eyes gazed oftener on the distant groups
than on his sister’s face, or the high crown. That
sister prayed, besought with tears that he would let
his guardian spirit guide him, that he would call upon
the messengers of the Throne to disarm the tempters
who were changing his heart. And yet he, the object
of that fond one’s watching thus far upon the road, he
who in sweet babyhood had been her pride and hope
even in her own young years, he turned and left her!
Turned and fled, not daring to look back and catch another
glimpse of her pale face! he fled, and how short
was now the way to Pleasure’s arms; the gain of long
year’s travels how quickly lost. He stood once more
where the two paths met, and looked a moment on the
plain below, where yet was green the home of his childhood’s
innocence. For a moment came the memory of
the spirits he had carried from it as inmates of his soul.
He gazed upon its quiet loveliness, and sighed in his
bewilderment and guilt, for the season of his infancy,
that he might be again a child and play amongst those
garden flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be! And sealing his brow with the
stamp of determined hardihood, he turned from the
retrospect of his boyhood’s purity, and gave his hand
to the fair-faced queen, who welcomed him more
gladly that he came from the rival path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How wildly did he enter now into all the scenes of
that gay place! He sought to drown his angel’s whisperings
in revels, and at first he succeeded well,
for the parties he joined were of those, who, like himself,
were neophytes to the reigning queen, and were
not yet quite slaves to the hideous form so shrouded in
flowers. But the innocent joyfulness grew more evil
at every step, for in this gay kingdom there was no
restraining power, and the poor misguided youth who
had left the quiet walk where every onward step induced
to purity, now saw the ruin which came by unsuspected
agencies upon the hearts and forms of these
thoughtless travelers. Guilt grew more familiar at
every turn. He could see that his companions grew
old before their time, and almost imperceptibly changed
their careless mirth and slight indulgences to wicked
merriment and love for evil practices, which they
would have once despised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Palaces rose up on every side, filled with sparkling
drinks, which drowned the voices of grieved angels,
and gave exulting life to the dread demon of Human
Will. The laughter which had come faintly to his ears
when he was by his lost sister’s side, like the sound
of a joyful stream, now was like a raging river, wild
and ruinous. Gay women fluttered on with “Vanity”
written in jewels upon their foreheads, and the beauty
of their girlhood lost under the weight of fashion’s
charms. How the heart of that lost wanderer turned
to his sister’s memory, and read there how chaste,
how simple, how lovely she walked, unmindful of the
garments her body wore if her spirit shone in the
garb of holiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked toward the path she was now treading
alone, and could tell her untiring step, and see the light
of her high brow as it was at times uplifted to the
throne—praying for him! Those gay women looked
like painted sepulchres as he turned back; and though
they shook their jeweled fingers at him playfully, and
tried to win his admiration by outward charms, his
heart compared them with the gentle presence of his
sister in the heavenly path, and it learned to lothe the
beings whose souls were unadorned and dark. They
had been beautiful, but had lost the roses of their
cheeks, the jewels of their eyes, the sweet sign of
modesty upon their brow, and now owed Art a debt
which grew with every year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went on he found corners of the road darkened
by groups of human forms with faces of spirits
from the cave of darkness where the fire burns. They
watched with starting eyes the ivory balls they rolled,
or painted characters they handled, as if they were
the chances of Heaven; and when their gold was lost
would start up furious, and commit some dreadful
deed upon themselves or their companions. Disgusting
pictures of indulgence and debauchery in every
shape, now met the almost frenzied eye of the regretful
wanderer. Carelessly besotted feet trod the uncertain
borders of the frightful precipice, or with uneven
step stalked on toward the gulf of hopelessness.
The light, which had been so dazzling at the commencement
of the way, had been put out, and darkness
would have been over all that crowd, if the
mercy of the Throne had not let its light fall upon the
guilty ones, that, if they would, they might see their
passage back to the holy way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! had that wanderer tasted all the joy he fancied
could be drunk of in that broad path? Had the glittering
scenes been real? Had the promises of the
syren been fulfilled? Had his heart been satisfied
with the friendship, his feet with the flowers of that
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
fair-seeming place? Oh, no! His brain was reeling
with the discordant sounds, his senses were confused,
his heart was agonized by the cries of rage, and complaints
breathed bitterly against the Throne. Oh!
could he dare brave the sneers of his companions and
turn back: Could he, distressed and weakened, run
the gauntlet of that deriding crowd! Oh no he had no
courage left for such a trial. He knew the purity of
his brow was gone, the freshness of his heart; and
how, if he ever should escape from that dreadful way,
would his sister’s eye rest on him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he thought of this, he turned toward the path of
her calm pilgrimage, and saw a greater light as a halo
round her pale brow, and her pleading eye still turned
upward toward the Throne! His angel gently whispered
“fly!” And as he stopped upon his course to
listen, he felt the pressure of the hand which had been
laid upon his head as he went out from the garden-gates,
and his strong heart came back! His feet forgot
their weariness, his eye grew large with hope, his
spirit threw off its cowardice, and with a loud, clear
voice, which his sister caught as a joyful answer to
her prayers, he declared himself a prodigal, and entreated
all that graceless company to follow him to
peace and happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! how many accents there were in the answering
shouts that filled the echoing way. Despair sent
up its dreadful note—shame and defiance added their
discordant tones. From the deep caves of guilty sorrow
came a wail, and from lone places where the
body diseased with crime lay suffering, a cry arose
which chilled even the polluted blood of those who
wandered in guilt so near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None answered the returning one with like repentance,
although from the heavy eyes of some a faint
desire for a moment gleamed, to flee with him from
misery. But the laugh which rung so loud, and with
such a mocking echo of contempt, put out the spark
which might have kindled to such a glorious blaze,
and he turned alone upon his backward way. And
now fingers were pointed at him, laughter followed
him—his garments were laid hold of to arrest his
steps. Many who sighed for his courage, and envied
him the way his face was turned, laid stumbling-blocks
before his feet, to turn them back—to gain a triumph
over him would make their own depravity seem less
dark. But they could not conquer him. His angel
strengthened him, and he kept the name of the Great
Lord upon his lips and in his heart, and so he made
his way free from the striving hands and tempting
wiles of his companions, and joyfully reached once
more the side of his sister in the upward path.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CAROLINA PARROT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is the only species of Parrot found native
in the United States. It not only abounds in the rich
and flowery groves of our Southern States, but is found
in great numbers among the prairies of the West, on
the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi, and even
along the shores of Lake Michigan. Most Parrots droop
or die in cold weather; but the Carolina Parrots are
frequently seen during a snow-storm, flying about in
flocks, and by their loud cries seeming to enjoy the
consciousness of their own hardiness. But though a
resident in our Western States it is rarely seen east of
the Alleghanies. Its favorite food—the seeds of the
cockle-bur—abounds in the wilds and forests of the
West. Amid the rich alluvial soils, shaded by dense
forests of sycamore and buttonwood, or covered with
impenetrable swamps, the Carolina finds a secure and
delightful retreat. Here also are found the seeds of
the cypress and hackberry, and the beech-nut; while
the soil abounds with those formations known as licks,
the salt of which is much relished by the Parrot. The
Carolina possesses a full share of that love for destructive
mischief which appears indigenous to his genus.
In the natural state it cares little for apples, if other
food be at hand, but it delights to mount an apple-tree,
and twisting the fruit off one by one to strew it over
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carolina Parrot is about thirteen inches long,
and twenty-one across the spread wings. The head
is red, the neck a rich yellow; and in other parts of
the body these colors are sprinkled with considerable
profusion. The remaining plumage is mostly a bright
green, changing to yellow, with light blue reflections.
The feet and bill are either a cream or flesh color, and
the claws and shafts of the large feathers black. The
plumage of the female differs very little from that of
the male; but the young birds undergo several changes
of color before assuming the dress of their parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In captivity this bird appears to lose little of its
sprightly habits, although it never becomes entirely
reconciled to the cage. Unless closely watched it will
gnaw and break through the wood of its cage, and
twist the wires, for the purpose of escaping. On the
whole, it is a pleasing companion, being in a great
measure destitute of the love for clamorous screaming
which distinguishes most of the other Parrots. Its
usual food in the cage should be corn and <a id='beech'></a>beech-nuts,
but if hungry it will eat apples, various kinds of seeds
and berries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson in his American Ornithology gives the following
interesting account of the Carolina Parrot, as
seen by him in its native haunts in the West:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Big Bone Lick, thirty miles above the mouth
of Kentucky River, I saw them in great numbers.
They came screaming through the woods in the morning,
about an hour after sunrise, to drink the salt water,
of which they, as well as the pigeons, are remarkably
fond. When they alighted on the ground, it appeared
at a distance as if covered with a carpet of the richest
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
green, orange and yellow; they afterward settled in
one body on a neighboring tree, which stood detached
from any other, covering almost every twig of it, and
the sun shining strongly on their gay and glossy plumage,
produced a very beautiful and splendid appearance.
Here I had an opportunity of observing some
very particular traits of their character: Having shot
down a number, some of which were only wounded,
the whole flock swept repeatedly around their prostrate
companions, and again settled on a low tree
within twenty yards of the spot where I stood. At
each successive discharge, though showers of them
fell, still the affection of the survivors seemed rather
to increase; for, after a few circuits around the place,
they again alighted near me, looking down on their
slaughtered companions with such manifest symptoms
of sympathy and concern, as completely disarmed me.
I could not but take notice of the remarkable contrast
between their elegant manner of flight and their lame
and crawling gait among the branches. They fly very
much like the Wild Pigeon, in close compact bodies,
and with great rapidity, making a loud and outrageous
screaming, not unlike that of the Red-headed Woodpecker.
Their flight is sometimes in a direct line, but
most usually circuitous, making a great variety of elegant
and easy serpentine meanders, as if for pleasure.
They are particularly attached to the large sycamore,
in the hollow of the trunks and branches of which they
generally roost, thirty or forty, or more, entering at
the same hole. Here they cling closely to the sides
of the trees, holding fast by the claws, and also by the
bills. They appear fond of sleep, and often retire to
their holes during the day, probably to take their regular
<span class='it'>siesta</span>. They are extremely sociable, and fond of
each other, often scratching each other’s heads and
necks, and always at night nestling as close as possible
to each other, preferring at that time a perpendicular
position, supported by their bill and claws. In the
fall, when their favorite cockle-burs are ripe, they
swarm along the coast or high ground of the Mississippi,
above New Orleans, for a great extent. At such
times they are killed and eaten by many of the inhabitants;
though, I confess, I think their flesh is very
indifferent. I have several times dined on it from necessity,
in the woods, but found it merely passable,
with all the sauce of a keen appetite to recommend it.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE WASHINGTON EAGLE. (<span class='it'>Haliætus Washingtonii.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time this bird was almost unknown; and
though specimens of it appear to have been examined
even by scientific men, its identity as a distinct species
remained hidden until the year 1814. In February of
that year Mr. Audubon, while voyaging up the Mississippi,
noticed here and there a solitary bird, soaring
above the rocky cliffs, entirely different, as it appeared
to him, from any species with which he was acquainted.
After much search he discovered an eyry on the
high cliffs of Green River, in Kentucky, and was enabled
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
to make such observations as convinced him that
this was a new, and hitherto unknown, species of
Eagle. From its noble bearing and majestic size, he
named it the Bird of Washington, a title by which it
is now generally recognized. Some, however, confound
it with the White-tailed Eagle, and others affirm
that it is but a full grown Sea Eagle. With better
reason it is supposed to be either identical with the
great European Sea Eagle of Brisson, or but a variety
of that bird. Audubon considers the species as rare.
His principal residence is among the rocky shores of
the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the great northern
lakes—in those gloomy solitudes rarely disturbed by
the step of man. Winter drives it from these favorite
haunts nearer to the abode of civilization; and in a
severe season the Washington Eagle has been seen in
the vicinity of Concord and Boston. His principal
food is fish; but instead of obtaining it in the same
piratical manner as is common with the Bald Eagle, he
descends, like the Osprey, into the same element with
his prey. The circles which he describes in flying
are wider than those of the White-headed Eagle,
and when about to dive for prey, he sweeps downward
in spiral rings, as though endeavoring to prevent
the fish’s escape. When within the distance
of a few yards, he darts forcibly down, and rarely
fails to secure his object. He is also remarkable
for flying near the surface of the water, especially
when retiring with his prize; and when near the
shore he may often be recognized by the same peculiarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Washington Eagle is capable of being domesticated,
and is then gentle and docile. The quantity of
food necessary to sustain him, either in captivity or
among his native wilds, is very great; and it would
appear that they are capable, more than most birds of
prey, of generating fat. Audubon’s specimen was
three feet six inches in length, and weighed fourteen
and a half pounds. Others have been weighed, much
heavier. It should be mentioned as a curious fact,
that repeated attempts by Dr. Haywood, of Boston, to
poison one of these birds with corrosive sublimate
were entirely unsuccessful, although doses of two
drams were given to it at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general color of the upper part of this bird is
copper-brown, dark and shining. The throat and
breast are a cinnamon color, the wings brown, with
sprinklings of black, and the lesser wing-coverts rusty
iron-gray. This description should, however, be received
with some caution, in consequence of its being
taken from but a few specimens, which varied considerably
among themselves. The head is more convex
than that of the Bald Eagle, the bill more hooked, and
the iris of the eye is hazel, inclining to chestnut. Underneath
the foot is notched like a rasp, to enable the
bird to hold its prey. The majestic appearance of this
Eagle, his great strength and superior size, justly entitle
him to a rank among the noblest birds of our continent.</p>

<div><h1><a id='books'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The History of the United States of America, from the Discovery
of the Continent to the Organization of the Government
under the Federal Constitution. By Richard Hildreth.
In three volumes. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers,
vol. 1.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The object of Mr. Hildreth’s ambition in this work is to
present an impartial view of the persons and events of
American history in their natural order and relations, and
in his preface he plumes himself on having accomplished
his purpose, at the same time not very modestly indicating
his belief that no other American historian has approached
it. As far as regards his claim to accuracy and impartiality
we doubt not it will be readily admitted, at least in
the sense in which he appears to understand the terms.
The history is a useful compendium of facts undertaken
by a man who does not seem to have sufficient sympathy
with his subject to be capable even of partisanship. Everything
indicates that the work was manufactured in a spirit
of dogged, straight-forward, joyless labor. The author
has in his other productions given evidence of passions
sufficiently quick and hot, and a talent for hating almost
unmatched for brilliancy and intensity, and our surprise
was correspondingly great to find him in the present work
altogether destitute of enthusiasm, and writing sentence
after sentence with no inspiration even from his blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To those who require in a history nothing but a series
of facts presented in a clear style, without any animation
in the narrative, the work of Mr. Hildreth will be very
acceptable, and we have little doubt that his labors of research
and composition will be rewarded. It seems to us,
however, that there is a great difference between facts as
they are in themselves, and facts as they are treated by
Mr. Hildreth. Whatever view may be taken of our fathers,
there can be no doubt that they were alive, and we have
a right to demand that the narrative of their actions, however
close it may adhere to the literal truth, shall represent
living men and living events. The representation of
a fact, therefore, implies a sympathy with it either personal
or imaginative, and a capacity to convey it to another
mind not only in its form and dimensions, but in its
coloring and spirit. The difficulty with Mr. Hildreth’s
facts consists in their lifelessness. He is “down among the
dead men,” not up and striving with the living, and his style
being deliberately and elaborately destitute of glow and
spirit, rejecting all ornament, and varying not with the
variations of his subject, is as uninteresting as a newspaper
account of a railroad accident. In his narrative of our history,
as far as we have read it, there are strictly speaking
no events. The landing of the Pilgrims he recounts in a
style which would hardly suit an account of a New Yorker’s
visit to Hoboken, for the purpose of enjoying a cooler air
than he found in the city. The most adventurous and heroic
actions, the grandest displays of disinterested piety and
affection, sink into dull commonplace as treated by Mr.
Hildreth. If this be history, then history is hardly worth
the attention of a live man. We should rather call it historical
geology, having for its subject the fossil remains
of men and institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know there is a large class of readers who consider
this mode of writing history as the best, and who are ready
to stigmatize all realization as romance. To such a class
we can commend Mr. Hildreth’s production. He certainly
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
deserves praise for his diligence, and the strength of understanding
he has evinced in educing a connected narrative
from his multitude of scattered authorities. But he
has not succeeded even in this department of his labors to
such a degree as to justify his sneering allusion to other
histories of the country as “Continental Sermons and
Fourth of July Orations in the guise of history.” This
hardly does justice to such a man as Bancroft, whose History
of the United States, whatever may be its faults, has
merits of investigation, narration and reflection, which
Mr. Hildreth’s more prosaic work does not approach.</p>

12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a most valuable addition to the English translations
of the Italian Classics, and is well calculated to convey
a vivid impression of the intense beauty and sublimity of
Dante’s immortal poem to readers ignorant of the original.
The translation is faithful even to literal exactness without
being clumsy and inelegant, and the Italian text has been
collated with commendable care and industry. Indeed the
whole book appears to have been a labor of love, and
must have occupied the leisure of many years. To those
who are learning Italian the volume must be invaluable,
as it enables them to read the original side by side with
a translation at once correct and elegant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Carlyle, the translator, is the brother of Thomas
Carlyle. One would suppose that being so nearly related
to the latter, he would sedulously avoid all imitation of
his manner, yet the preface to the present volume is filled
with the most amusing <span class='it'>Carlylisms</span>. The tone and rhetorical
contortions of his brother, Dr. Carlyle mimics
rather than imitates, and makes the whole matter more
ludicrous by his evident straining after that which on all
principles of propriety he should rather attempt strenuously
to avoid.</p>

one of the first caricaturists in the country, and an

illustrations are pictorial essays on popular follies and
vices, and contain matter enough to supply thought for a

Protean genius of humbug to diddle our free and enlightened

by Jesse Cato Daniel. New York: D. Bixby.

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bixby, the publisher of this elegant little volume, has
done a great deal in his selection of books for republication
for the elevation of public taste. To him we owe the only
editions we have of Goethe’s Faust, and Correspondence
of Southey’s Translation of the Chronicle of the Cid, and
of a number of other valuable works. Having removed
from Lowell to New York, we trust that he will continue
his speculations on public taste; and as an earnest
of what he intends to do, we hail with much pleasure this
handsome edition of Cousin’s celebrated dissertation on
Beauty, a work written with all that accomplished philosopher’s
force and brilliancy of style, evincing his usual
keenness of analysis and range of generalization, and as
readable as it is valuable. We commend it especially to
those English readers who are followers of Alison and
Jeffrey. The subject discussed is one of the most important
in the metaphysics of criticism, and though we
cannot say that Cousin has exhausted it, he has presented
his own views in a rhetoric so lucid that he cannot
fail to charm even the readers whom he may not convince.</p>

John Wood Warter, B. D. New York: Harper &amp;

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is calculated to convey even a new idea of
the variety of Southey’s studies, and the exhaustlessness
of his capacity of labor. The number of his works is
sufficiently surprising, convicting as it does most literary
men either of indolence or barrenness, but we find that in
addition to writing his original productions, he was in the
custom of transcribing largely from books as he read them,
and the present volume, representing but a portion of
these labors, would appear to most readers a work for a
life. It consists of striking extracts from a large variety
of authors, most of them antiquated to the reader of the
present day, and illustrating the manners, custom,
opinions, and sentiments of Englishmen for the last three
centuries. The editor, who reports himself as Southey’s
son-in-law, is an excellent specimen of a snob, who
cannot write a sentence without writing himself down an
ass. The Harpers have issued the volume in clear type,
on white paper, at about one-fifth the price of the English
edition.</p>

C. L. Gieseler. Translated from the German by Samuel
Davidson, LL. D. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
2 vols. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publishers of these volumes have rarely issued a
book more intrinsically valuable than the present. It is a
work of immense research and labor, undertaken by a
German Professor of Theology, and indicating vast erudition.
The translation by Dr. Davidson is a faithful reflection
of the original, even to the extent of preserving
Gieseler’s rather inelegant though condensed style of
writing. The advantage of the work to students consists
in its stating results only in the text, and reserving the
notes for authorities and processes. It is a text book, not
an elaborate history like Neander’s, and as such it has obtained
great reputation for impartiality and ability. The
American translator has availed himself of the latest German
edition, and his version is accordingly the most
valuable which has been made on either side of the
Atlantic.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
